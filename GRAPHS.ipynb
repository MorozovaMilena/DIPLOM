       "['It s been a well-known fact for quite some time that Donald Trump doesn t handle criticism particularly well , but what has become glaringly obvious during his ten-month tenure as the President of the United States is that if his skin were any thinner , he would need to be carried around in a bucket . Remember , this is the same man who filed a $ 5 billion libel lawsuit against author Timothy O Brien for causing actual malice by claiming that Trump was only a multi-millionaire , not a billionaire.Since he s been in office , President Trump has had a fixation on size , from exaggerating the size of the crowd present at his inauguration and other public appearances , to that of the size of his Manhattan penthouse in Trump Tower and even the height of the building itself for that matter.Trump is not a small man , standing around 6 1 , although I ll say 6 2 to save myself from any legal ramifications , but he does have a clear-cut Napoleonic complex.People have been giving Trump a hard time about the size of his hands since the 1980s when Spy magazine dubbed him a short-fingered vulgarian . The references to the size of then-candidate Trump s hands gathered steam again during his presidential campaign , something that has stuck in his craw to this day with the President still feeling the need to justify his hand size . My hands are too big ! he said as he attempted to put on a pair of latex gloves while serving meals in early September to those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston.If one man could be that affected by a claim that he has small hands , then how would he feel if his entire body were small ? We don t exactly know yet , but people are photoshopping Trump to appear small in photos to hilarious effect to get under his skin and the results are just brilliant.There are several approaches photo manipulators are taking , the most obvious being to make him out to be the child that he is : Others are just opting to make Trump seem tiny in general , but particularly when he s in the company of other world leaders : If there s one way to drive a sexist crazy , it is to make them seem minuscule in the presence of a woman , particularly family members . In Trump s case , there s the added advantage of making that woman his arch nemesis , Hilary Clinton : This is a trend that is certainly going to go viral so if you think you ve got some photoshop skills , it s time to get to work and feel free to post your masterpieces in the comments.Featured image via screenshot',\n",
       " 'Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face ? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27 , 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months . The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop . It is in everyone s best interest to share ( this ) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform , Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door , a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle , shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West , who had a criminal record including prior gun charges , was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire , killing him.Moynihan , 34 , is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal . We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous , said Rev . Mark Scott , of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death tragic , but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer , you don t leave the police any other option but to respond . The Suffolk District Attorney s office is investigating the shootings and has said it will release a full report on the incident later.Via :',\n",

       " 'Just a day before the Iowa caucuses , a former field organizer for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has come forward with accusations that Trump s campaign grossly discriminated against women , paying them less than the male employees doing the same exact work.These completely believable accusations were made by Elizabeth Mae Davidson and published by The New York Times . The 26-year-old staffer had been working for Trump s campaign in Davenport , Iowa but was fired a month ago despite being previously described as one of the campaign s most effective organizers.On Thursday , Davidson filed a complaint about the discrimination with the Davenport Civil Rights Commission . Aside from the gender pay discrimination , Davidson reported that she was also given less opportunities to advance her career and skills . To make matters worse , female staffers were also subjected to inappropriate comments about their appearance from Donald Trump himself . The Times wrote : [ Davidson ] said in a discrimination complaint that men doing the same jobs were paid more and were allowed to plan and speak at rallies , while her requests to do so were ignored . She also said that when she and a young female volunteer met Mr. Trump at a rally last summer , he told them , You guys could do a lot of damage , referring to their looks.In an interview , Davidson revealed that she was paid $ 2,000 per month . Because she was also working as a paralegal , she was considered a part-time staffer by the campaign . However , one of her male peers with the exact same role in the campaign was paid almost double despite the fact that he also has another job ! Trump s campaign public filings state that several men filling the same role as Davidson were being paid between $ 3,500 to $ 4,000 a month.According to Dorothy A. O Brien , Davidson s attorney , the complaint will trigger the Davenport civil rights agency to investigate Trump s campaign , and after 60 days Davidson can choose to let the agency continue its investigation or follow suit in state court.Considering Trump s horrible track record of sexist , misogynistic comments toward women , it s not a big surprise to hear that his campaign was discriminating against its female staffers . When Davidson was asked if she would be attending Monday s caucuses , she was undecided . She said : Some of the bad things about him I dismissed , because I was working for the candidate . Now I m more critical , especially how he treats women . We don t blame her.Featured image via Gage Skidmore',\n",
       " '- Pope Francis ’ s remarks on Thursday that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is “ not Christian ” due to his views on immigration sparked jokes on social media , and the pope quickly trended on Twitter in the United States . The businessman and former reality TV star called the pope ’ s comments “ disgraceful ” and said he was proud to be a Christian . Twitter users poked fun at the brouhaha . “ Watching Trump fight with the Pope might be the most fun you can have with your clothes on , ” tweeted actor Albert Brooks ( @ AlbertBrooks ) . Television comedy writer Wendy Molyneux ( @ WendyMolyneux ) joked about the controversy by attributing a fake quotation to Trump that mocked the presidential candidate ’ s penchant for bawdy exaggeration . “ ‘ You know , a lot of my friends are Popes , and they love what I ’ m doing . This one Pope is such a loser . And fat. ’ - @ realDonaldTrump , ” Molyneux wrote Thursday . Paul Begala ( @ PaulBegala ) , a political consultant who is an adviser to a Super PAC helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , said : “ How long before realDonaldTrump says the Pope is totally broke . Doesn ’ t own a single golf course . Never even dated a supermodel . # Loser. ” “ How dare the pope be concerned with the poor & disenfranchised ! I mean Jesus never was ! ” tweeted actor Rainn Wilson ( @ rainnwilson ) . “ The Late Show , ” hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert , tweeted a poll Thursday in which it asked “ How can Donald Trump get back in the Pope ’ s good graces ? ” The options listed were “ Cabinet position , ” “ Purchase indulgences , ” “ Evict Protestants ” and “ Sensual back rub. ” Trump , long the leader in national opinion polls , and five Republican rivals face off on Saturday in South Carolina ’ s primary . While the pope and Trump are now at odds , the real estate developer had previously praised the pontiff . In 2013 , the year Francis began his papacy , Trump compared himself to the pope favorably . On Christmas Day 2013 : Trump tweeted , “ The new Pope is a humble man , very much like me , which probably explains why I like him so much ! ” The pope was not the only powerful figure to run afoul of the Republican candidate on Thursday . Media titan Rupert Murdoch weighed in on Twitter to contest Trump ’ s claims that Fox News is biased against him after a national poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed Senator Ted Cruz inching ahead of Trump . “ Trump blames me for WSJ poll , fights FoxNews , ” tweeted Murdoch ( @ rupertmurdoch ) , executive chairman of both Fox News parent 21st Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ) and Journal owner News Corp ( NWSA.O ) . “ Time to calm down . If I running anti-Trump conspiracy then doing lousy job ! ” For more on the 2016 presidential race , see the blog , “ Tales from the Trail ” ( here ) .',\n",
       " 'Everyone knows that Republican front runner Donald Trump s Twitter account is filled with nonsense and an absolute nightmare for any level-headed American . Trump has successfully funneled all of that bigotry and offensive rhetoric to his Instagram account , as the business mogul has just posted a completely baffling ad meant to insult Hillary Clinton while nearly destroying his friendly relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin.Trump has previously spoken positively about Putin and defended the Russian leader several times , which won him Putin s support for presidency . But in the ad , it doesn t seem like Trump likes Putin at all it even seems like he s trying to destroy their mutually respectful bond . In the video , Putin performs MMA-style combat moves for a few seconds before a clip of an ISIS soldier pointing a gun at the camera is shown . The text reads : When it comes to facing our toughest opponents , the Democrats have the perfect answer And right as the text disappears , Trump goes after Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by showing a clip where Clinton is barking which is ironic since Clinton was actually doing this to mock Republicans for not being able to fight our toughest opponents . This footage of Clinton is from a campaign rally in February , and happened after telling a story about an old campaign ad that made a dog bark whenever someone lied . Clinton was implying that the GOP candidates were lying through their teeth about several of their claims . Having this clip in Trump s ad is completely out of context , and makes it even more confusing.After the footage of Clinton barking , the video cuts to some really uncomfortable footage of Putin giggling creepily . The last line in the ad reads , We don t need to be a punch line ! The ad is about 15 long seconds that make absolutely no sense just like Trump himself.Is this what we want for a President ? A video posted by Donald J. Trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) on Mar 16 , 2016 at 9:15am PDTFor someone who doesn t want America to become a punchline , Trump has done an amazing job making our politics look like a joke . Unfortunately , this video is getting tons of positive attention from Trump s 1.2 million Instagram followers . Since being posted this afternoon , it has already received over 22,000 likes and thousands of comments.Trump has previously railed against Clinton for imitating a dog . During a South Carolina rally , Trump criticized the former Secretary of State , stating that the press would bury him if he acted the same way . He said , If I ever did that , I would be ridiculed all over the place . I won t do it . I m not going to imitate her . However , we all know that Trump has done far worse.Given that Trump has a history of misogyny and attacks on women , this strange anti-Clinton ad is nothing new . And it makes about just as much sense as he does . Featured image via Evan Guest / Flickr',\n",
       " 'WARSAW - Poland will remain reliant on coal for power generation for now but in future should consider turning to nuclear energy and renewable sources , the new prime minister said on Tuesday in his first policy speech . Mateusz Morawiecki , a Western-educated former banker fluent in German and English , was sworn in on Monday , replacing Beata Szydlo , a coalminer s daughter , who had promised to keep mining jobs when the industry struggled to survive in 2015 . Morawiecki s did not signal a major departure for now from the pro-coal policies of his ruling Law and Justice Party ( PiS ) , but his comments did suggest the government could give a push to a much-delayed plan to build Poland s first nuclear power plant . Today coal is the basis of our energy industry and we can not and do not want to give it up , Morawiecki said . For our future generations , I would also like alternative energy sources to develop freely in Poland . Our task is to guarantee Poland the energy independence at low carbon emissions and this is why we look favorably at nuclear energy , he said . He also said the nation should consider renewable power sources . A project to build a nuclear power plant was announced in 2009 , but has been hit by several delays , with financing posing one of the main obstacles . Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski has been pushing to build the nuclear plant but needs cabinet approval for a renewed push . Morawiecki may have given those plans a boost . PiS has long championed Poland s use of coal , a fuel that is falling out of favor in a global push to cut greenhouse gases . But global pressures to shift away from coal and Poland s shrinking deposits are encouraging the country to consider its future plans for power generation , analysts say .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump has begun paying his own legal bills related to the Russia investigation and will no longer cover the costs using political donations to his re-election campaign or the Republican Party , his attorneys confirmed on Friday . Trump defense lawyer John Dowd said that following payments by the Republican National Committee , the president began paying the bills and now wants to make the party “ even. ” The RNC confirmed it is no longer paying the bills . The expenses cover personal lawyers representing Trump in special prosecutor Robert Mueller ’ s probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in last year ’ s election . Moscow has denied meddling in the election , and Trump has denied any collusion . The investigation has hounded Trump ’ s presidency . Mueller already has secured an indictment of Trump ’ s former campaign chief and another aide , while a third former adviser pleaded guilty . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has offered shifting accounts of his Russia contacts while he was a campaign adviser , including with Moscow ’ s former ambassador to the United States , Sergei Kislyak , and his knowledge of contacts between the campaign and Russian intermediaries . But Sessions made light of the investigation during a speech on Friday before a conservative lawyers ’ group . “ Is Ambassador Kislyak in the room ? Before I get started here , any Russians ? ” Sessions said , prompting applause and laughter from the crowd at the Federalist Society event . “ Anybody been to Russia ? Got a cousin in Russia or something ? ” Special White House counsel Ty Cobb said the administration was working with others to establish a legal fund for current and former staffers . Dowd said White House counsel Don McGahn and campaign lawyer Ben Ginsberg of Jones Day are working to structure that fund , which would be subject to rules that prohibit staff from receiving gifts or pro bono legal service . The president is exempt from those rules , Dowd said . “ The geniuses are working on it , ” Dowd said . “ If it passes muster with the tax lawyers and accountants , then it has to pass muster with the Office of Government Ethics. ” During former President Bill Clinton ’ s administration , private funds were raised to cover Clinton ’ s legal expenses related to the Whitewater investigation . Under former President George W. Bush , a legal fund was set up to help former Bush staffer Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , but only after he had left White House employment . In August , first reported that the RNC was paying Trump ’ s legal bills , which amounted to more than $ 230,000 that month . The payments were made to Trump ’ s outside legal team , which includes Dowd . Additionally , Trump ’ s re-election campaign paid more than $ 300,000 this year in bills to lawyers representing his son , Donald Trump Jr. , according to public disclosures . The campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether it will continue to pay for Trump Jr ’ s legal expenses . The Federal Election Commission allows use of private campaign funds to pay legal bills arising from being a candidate or elected official . While previous presidential campaigns have used these funds to pay for routine legal matters such as ballot access disputes and compliance requirements , Trump is the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use such funds on the costs of responding to a criminal probe , said election law experts .',\n",
       " 'President Obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act resulted in humiliating failure on Friday.Once again , Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their Trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many Republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation.The bill would have repealed the Affordable Care Act , stripping healthcare from over 20 million Americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket.Donald Trump , of course , immediately blamed Democrats for the defeat even though Republicans control the House , Senate , and the White House.In short , Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country.Adding insult to injury , Fox News anchor Bret Baier forcefully pointed out that while Republicans went down in flames , President Obama won the day . Let me just say one thing , the biggest winner today : President Barack Obama , who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law , Baier began . It is now clear that Republicans can not do , at least yet , what they planned on doing in the campaign , after campaign from 2010 , 2012 , 2014 , 2016 , repeal and replace was the mantra . Indeed , Republicans rehearsed their repeal of the Affordable Care Act incessantly , holding over 60 useless symbolic votes over the years . But when push came to shove , Republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government . Barack Obama has the win right now , and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare , Baier continued . It is now the Democrats version , the ideology , that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form . Thousands of Americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront Republicans in defense of the Affordable Care Act and only 17 percent of Americans approved of their bill.And in the end , not enough Republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead.In conclusion , Baier echoed Fox Business host Stuart Varney by noting that Republicans control Congress and the White House but still could not get anything done . The repeal , drag it up by the root has not worked , Baier said . They can t get it through a Republican House , a Republican Senate and a Republican president . Today is a win for President Barack Obama . Here s the video via YouTube.Americans should remain vigilant , however , and continue to watch Republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through . Just like the Affordable Care Act failed a few times before it passed , the GOP could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote . It will be up to each and every one of us to make sure they fail again . But for now , the Affordable Care Act is the law and Republicans should accept that and get over it.Featured image via Pete Souza',\n",
       " 'Maine Governor Paul LePage has made quite a name for himself with his casual , yet blatant , racism . But when someone calls him out on his bigoted remarks , he apparently gets his feelings hurt because he is such a sensitive guy underneath his hardened exterior . Well , what does he do when someone tells the truth and his feelings ? Why , he throws a temper tantrum of course.LePage said on Wednesday that he was just downright crushed when he heard the news that Maine lawmaker Drew Gattine had called him a racist . Turns out this wasn t even true , but LePage , being ever so devastated that he was called a racist for saying racist things , decided to respond by leaving a voicemail for Gattine calling him a c * cksucker and a son of a b * tch . Don t forget , though , Lepage is the one we should feel sorry for . He s the sensitive soul who just happens to say incredibly insensitive , racist stuff . But dammit , calling him a racist just goes too far . It hurts his feels ! I may not supposed to be that sensitive to these things , but I am , LePage confessed . I lose sleep over this , and it s frustrating when you hear people talk about cheap political stunts to hurt their opponent and not do the right thing . Being called a racist was a horrible thing for me . It was enormously hurtful . It hurt my family . So just what does the good governor plan to do about all this ? Maybe try to stop spouting all the disgustingly racist things that have a habit of pouring out of his mouth ? Nope . He s sensitive . Just like a baby . So he s throwing a temper tantrum and has announced that he isn t going to talk to the press anymore so that he doesn t get caught saying these racist things . That ll teach the media ! I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today , LePage said . And I m serious . Everything will be put in writing . I am tired of being caught the gotcha moments . LePage made headlines when he said that all black people are drug dealers with names like D-Money , Smoothie , Shifty who come to his great state to impregnate young white girls . He has ranted about immigrants working in restaurants , saying he needs an interpreter to understand them . Then last week he declared that he is at war and naturally , he outright declared that blacks and Hispanics are the enemy . Featured image via YouTube',\n",
       " 'In an unprecedented move , the Trump administration is considering not submitting a budget to Congress next year . He would do this to avoid criticism and it s not illegal even though the Congressional Budget Act requires the president to submit the fiscal 2018 budget to Congress between January 2nd and February 6th . As Forbes notes , Trump could easily say that it was the responsibility of the outgoing Obama administration to comply with the law before the new president was sworn in on January 20 . Forbes source of this news was someone in the GOP congressional leadership.Again , this is unprecedented , but there s a reason # TrumpFirsts was trending on Twitter yesterday . Clearly , the man doesn t know how to President : Every in-coming president since the Congressional Budget Act went into effect in the mid-1970s has submitted a budget . In many years , those budgets ( or amendments to the outgoing president s final budget ) were submitted months after the first-Monday-in-February deadline and were truncated versions of the usual multi-volume presentation . But , a fiscal plan with the new president s priorities was consistently released for over 4 decades.A newly elected President is typically eager to submit a budget the first year because it s an opportunity to display the details and plans for things to come . It s showing the new President s priorities . But after a budget is submitted , it gives a platform for those who will criticize the administration . So if there s no proposal then there s no criticism.And as for those promises Trump made : it would also eliminate the need for the administration to publish a table with the very optimistic GDP growth promised during the campaign , the high interest rates many economists think are coming and Trump s unrealistic assumptions on jobs and unemployment.This is coming from a man who didn t release his taxes during his campaign . That , too , is not presidential . We d love to hear a good defense on this from Trump supporters . Y all got burned and we re going to have to clean another Republican President s mess up when he creates an apocalyptic economy . By the way , the jobless rate is 4.6 percent right now . Watch how fast that increases._____________________________________________________________________________________Photo by Alex Wong via Getty .',\n",
       " '- Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri urged state lawmakers on Tuesday to move quickly on legislation to restructure the financially ailing Detroit Public Schools ( DPS ) before the district runs out of money . “ Sometime this spring or early summer , unless legislation passes in some form , the district will not be able to make payroll , will not be able to pay vendors . Essentially they will be out of cash , ” Khouri told the Michigan Senate ’ s Government Operations Committee . The committee has been holding hearings this month on bills supported by Republican Governor Rick Snyder to create two entities - the Detroit Community District to run the schools , and the current Detroit Public Schools to retire debt . Khouri said the legislation presents a better option for DPS and Michigan than a bankruptcy which would “ not make sense ” given much of the district ’ s debt is owed to the state . He added that bankruptcy could also take a year at a cost of as much as $ 100 million . Unlike the city of Detroit ’ s bankruptcy , a DPS filing would put the state on the hook for $ 1.45 billion over 11 years to pay off bonds issued for DPS through Michigan ’ s school bond loan fund , according to written testimony Khouri submitted to the committee . Under the governor ’ s plan , the new community school district would be provided with $ 715 million in additional state funding over 10 years to offset local property taxes , which would be tapped by the old district to pay off debt . Another $ 240 million in DPS pension debt could be shifted onto other school districts in the state-wide teachers ’ retirement system . Detroit exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014 , shedding about $ 7 billion of its $ 18 billion of debt . The Senate committee , which will continue its hearing on the legislation next week , also heard from teachers ’ union officials and parents who contended Michigan should be responsible for paying off debt accumulated by DPS since it was placed under state oversight in 2009 . They also called for an elected board to be in control of the schools . The legislation would create a financial oversight commission for the district .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted Charter Communications Inc ’ s decision to invest $ 25 billion in the United States and a plan the company announced before he was elected to hire 20,000 workers over four years . At a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable company ’ s Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott , Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States . Much of the announcement was not new . Charter said last May that it planned to add 20,000 jobs as part of its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks . As early as June 2015 , Rutledge said Charter would need an additional 20,000 employees after those deals . On a number of occasions , Trump has touted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced The company said more than a year ago in February 2016 that it planned to close foreign Time Warner Cable call centers and move the jobs to the United States . On Friday , Trump said , “ We ’ re embracing a new economic model - the American Model . We ’ re going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations - that has started already , big league - reduce government burdens , and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers . “ You ’ re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs , of companies , and everything coming back into our country. ” Charter , which has 24 million residential and business customers in 41 states , said on Friday it had committed to Trump to hiring those workers within four years . It plans to invest $ 25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years . In May 2016 Rutledge said in a recorded interview there would be some overlap in management positions ( after the TWC merger ) but said the company would hire about 20,000 people over four years . Rutledge said the broadband investment was being made “ in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate ... We ’ re committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country. ” Charter agreed in May 2016 to make significant broadband investment under a deal with the Federal Communications Commission that was part of winning approval to acquire the cable networks . At that time Charter agreed to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years , with one million served by a broadband competitor . Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday that the commission was “ working to set rules of the road that encourage companies to build and upgrade broadband networks across the country. ” He credited the FCC ’ s “ investment-friendly policies ” in part for Charter ’ s commitments . The agency is considering a petition by the American Cable Association to strike the requirement Charter extend service to areas already served by companies because it could harm smaller competitors . Charter also touted its plans to open a new bilingual call center in McAllen , Texas and said it expects to employ 600 there by the end of 2018 . Plans to open a call center in Texas were announced last October . In December , Trump announced that telecommunications group Sprint Corp and U.S. satellite company OneWeb would bring 8,000 jobs to the United States , and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by Japan ’ s SoftBank Group Corp . In January , Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said of its decision to shift 5,000 call center jobs to the United States that the company “ had plans to do this for a while . ”',\n",
       " 'Just when you thought the 2014 election results would provide America with some checks and balances U.S. lawmakers narrowly approved legislation key to securing a hallmark Pacific trade deal on Thursday , partly reversing a defeat less than a week before , in a boost to President Barack Obama s goal of strengthening U.S. economic ties with Asia.The House of Representatives voted 218 to 208 to give the White House authority to close trade deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , which encompasses 40 percent of the global economy and is close to completion.But the bill , a stripped-down version of legislation which failed at a vote last week , must now go back to the Senate for approval , where a vote is likely next week.The House has been wrestling for weeks with fast-track authority , which lets lawmakers set negotiating objectives for trade deals , such as the TPP , but restricts them to a yes-or-no vote on the finished agreement.Democrats last week dramatically rejected a personal appeal from Obama to back legislation central to his hallmark Pacific Rim trade deal by voting down a companion measure to renew an expiring program to help workers hurt by trade.The trade package consists of three basic components.That measure was cut from the bill approved on Thursday , but the change from the original legislation ensures a return to the Senate , delaying final passage further.In debate before the vote , many Democrats lined up on the House floor to voice their anger with Obama s trade initiative . This thing is modeled after NAFTA ( North American Free Trade Agreement ) , which cost us 5 million jobs , said veteran Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter.RELATED COVERAGE House speaker : Confident in pretty good place on trade vote Republicans , weary of the long struggle to pass fast-track , urged the House to vote and move on . Enacting trade promotion authority is critical for our economy and for our national security , and so we re going to get it done here today , Ways and Means Committee chairman Paul Ryan , a Republican , said.CLOCK TICKINGDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden told pro-trade Democrats were determined to pass both fast-track and the worker aid program and were working on a plan to achieve that goal.House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped the Senate would soon take up fast-track and the worker aid program , which would be tacked on to a bill renewing trade benefits for African countries.But members of the Congressional Black Caucus have warned against using the bill as a bargaining chip and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi , who voted against fast-track , said she did not see a path forward for the worker aid program.Many Democrats , who have strong links to trade unions , fear trade deals such as the TPP will cost U.S. jobs as employers chase lower costs in signatory countries.The House vote is a good sign for the TPP , which would harmonize standards on issues like intellectual property and labor protections and lower trade barriers among the dozen emerging and developed countries.Approval of the TPP would open new markets for major U.S. exporters such as Boeing ( BA.N ) , Ford ( F.N ) , IBM ( IBM.N ) , Caterpillar ( CAT.N ) , Merck ( MRK.N ) and Cisco ( CSCO.O ) , policy analysts said.Negotiators are under pressure to finish the pact , which is already more than five years in the making , to allow the TPP to clear Congress before 2016 U.S. presidential election campaigns dominate the agenda.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has yet to take a stand on the deal , but the former secretary of state has said Obama should take on board legitimate concerns expressed by fellow Democrats.Some TPP partner countries , including Japan and Canada , want fast track in place before making final offers on the trade deal , which economists estimate would boost the global economy by almost $ 300 billion a year.Trade deals are controversial in the United States , which has a share of exports to gross domestic product roughly half that of China , partly because of the country s past experience with NAFTA.That pact freed up trade between the United States , Canada and Mexico and , more than two decades later , is blamed by many for U.S. factory closures and job losses and has soured sentiment toward the TPP .',\n",

       " 'Sounds great how about a new car ? An immigrant-rights group proposed a Bill of Rights for illegal immigrants Thursday , demanding that Americans recognize there are millions already in the country who deserve health care , in-state tuition rates for college and a guarantee of citizenship in the long term.The list of demands runs 10 items long the same as the U.S. Constitution s Bill of Rights and also calls for an end to arrests and deportations for all law-abiding undocumented Americans . The document was circulated by United We Stay , which is a group of illegal immigrants , first generation Americans and human rights activists pushing for changes to immigration law . We know we have human rights , even though our very presence is deemed illegal and our existence alien . Now we have our own Bill of Rights and we want it to be the framework for every immigration decision going forward from the local to the national level , the group said in a statement announcing their demands.The 10 points include a demand that they be accorded respect ; calls for citizenship rights and an immediate deferment of deportations ; in-state tuition at public colleges ; wage equality ; medical care ; and protection against deportation if illegal immigrants report a crime as a witness.The list also includes a specific demand for compelled authorization of birth certificates for our U.S.-born children . That appears to be pushback against the state of Texas , where officials have ruled that parents must present valid ID to get children s birth certificates and have deemed the Mexican government s Matricula Consular ID card not to be acceptable as primary identification.A federal court has allowed that Texas policy to go into effect , ruling that there are questions about the reliability of the Mexican cards and that state officials have an interest in making sure only authorized relatives are able to get birth certificates.The list of rights begins with a protest against the terms illegal and alien . Immigrant-rights advocates say both terms are dehumanizing , and have offered undocumented workers or , in the case of United We Stand , Undocumented Americans , as their preferred term.The document is meant to serve as a goalpost for the ongoing immigration debate . Immigrant-rights groups had been gaining ground in recent years , with polls suggesting Americans were increasingly open to legalization.A legalization bill even passed the Senate in 2013 but Democrats , who controlled the chamber , never sent it to the GOP-run House for action.The issue then stalled last year after President Obama took unilateral action to grant a deportation amnesty to as many as 5 million of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Federal courts have put that amnesty on hold , but Mr. Obama s other policies stopping deportations for most illegal immigrants remain in place , which has effectively checked off one of the list of rights demands .

With Obama leaving office now , and his swearing-in ceremony looming , he only has one option left : Retain Obama s staffers , at least for the time being.That has to be galling for someone who keeps insisting he s the best at everything , has the best of everything , and has a cabinet with the highest IQ ever ( don t make us laugh too hard , sir ) . He clearly isn t the best at appointing staff or working with other people . Senior Obama administration officials , along with some Republican lawmakers , have watched with growing alarm as the pace of the transition stops and starts . They ve said , repeatedly , that Trump s team won t coordinate with them.The Times says that aides released the names of over a dozen fresh appointments , but that barely scratches the surface of what they have to do . They also announced that they would keep 50 essential personnel in both the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security for the time being , including current Obama appointee Thomas A. Shannon Jr. , who will stay on as acting Secretary of State pending Rex Tillerson s confirmation.Other Obama officials sticking around for now include : And White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to spin it as ensuring continuity of government . Har de har har.Things are so terrible that Strobe Talbott , the president of the Brookings Institution and former Clinton official , said : In 21 years of covering the State Department and in eight years of serving there , I ve seen rocky transitions and experienced what feels like a hostile takeover , but I ve never seen anything like this . 21 years is a long time to never see anything like this.For his part , Trump really doesn t seem to care . He s floating around Washington , working to draw the crowds he so desperately needs to keep his ego properly inflated and still avoiding a lot of real work . He s acting like the demagogue he is , preparing to be crowned tomorrow , rather than sworn in . He even said it was bad karma to get too involved with the transition , and , according to the Times report , wanted to stop planning altogether.Besides , appointing people to his administration ? That s grunt work . He s above grunt work.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - A U.S. appeals court on Friday granted a Trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to former President Barack Obama ’ s regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants , rules that the Republican president is moving to undo . A 10-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the request to put the litigation involving the regulations , known as the Clean Power Plan , in abeyance for at least 60 days while the administration plans its next steps . The court also asked the administration and other parties to file briefs on whether the case should be sent back to the Environmental Protection Agency . The Supreme Court last year put the regulations on hold pending the outcome of the case . In a separate order issued on Friday , the same court put on hold a case challenging another set of Obama climate regulations aimed at new power plants . Twenty-seven states , led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups , challenged the Obama regulation . Other states and environmental groups backed the former administration . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who sided with the previous administration ’ s EPA to defend the Clean Power Plan , brushed off the court ’ s move , saying it simply puts the litigation on hold for 60 days . “ Today ’ s temporary pause in the litigation does not relieve EPA of its legal obligation to limit carbon pollution from its largest source : fossil-fueled power plants , ” Schneiderman said . “ I will continue to fight in court to ensure EPA fulfills its legal responsibility. ” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey , who led the challenge against the rule , said Friday ’ s decision signaled that the court has acknowledged the change in the political landscape “ and that a decision on the merits is not appropriate at this time. ” An executive order by Trump was part of his effort to cut federal environmental regulations to revive the energy drilling and coal mining industries , a promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign . Energy analysts and executives have questioned whether Trump ’ s broad moves against environmental regulations will provide a big benefit for their industries , and environmentalists have called his actions reckless . The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from existing U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels . It was seen as the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions-reduction target it promised to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December 2015 . Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions . David Cherney , an energy analyst for PA Consulting , said the D.C . Circuit ruling gives the Trump administration more time to come up with a replacement to the Clean Power Plan , which will inevitably be followed by more legal challenges . “ Any change to the Clean Power Plan by the Trump administration will be challenged in courts and would need to be sufficiently justified to survive legal challenge from the environmental lobby , ” Cherney said .',\n",

       " 'Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway ran into a buzzsaw named Wolf Blitzer on Monday and she was absolutely shredded with facts.The CNN host grilled Conway for being a hypocrite when it comes to women who are accusing Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault versus the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault twenty years ago . Why do you believe that voters should believe Bill Clinton s accusers , there are several of them , but not Donald Trump s accusers ? Blitzer asked during The Situation Room after pointing out a tweet by Conway saying that she agrees with Hillary Clinton that every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard . Conway responded by basically walking back her tweet and then started ranting about evidence and that belief should only apply if the women take Trump to court . Of course , the statute of limitations pretty much prevents any meaningful judgment from coming down . Meanwhile , Bill Clinton s accusers did not file their own claims in court until after they went public in the media . Juanita Broaddrick , who accused Bill Clinton of raping her , even filed a sworn affidavit claiming that the rape allegations were not true , thus contradicting her own retraction later on.Conway also tried to change the subject , but Wolf didn t let her off the hook , and that led to Conway whining about how little air time Bill Clinton s accusers supposedly received at the time they made their accusations . These woman got nearly no air time compared to the air time that was given on CNN and other places , Wolf , to the accusers of Donald Trump , she complained . It s simply unfair and unbalanced . It s also a complete fabrication . You see , Wolf Blitzer was a Senior White House Correspondent at the time so he remembers the media circus surrounding the accusations against Clinton and he brutally reminded Conway of that fact and the fact that she should know better since she was there as well . Let me just point out , I was CNN s Senior White House Correspondent in 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , when these women , including of course Monica Lewinsky , got tons and tons and tons of air time . You remember those days , I remember those days . We all remember those days , we went through all of those cases , these women who have come forward . We gave them a lot of reporting time . When Blitzer continued by asking Conway if she would encourage Trump s supporters to go to court , she quickly denied doing that . You know , because Trump would be forced to go to court as well.Conway proceeded to argue that Hillary s conduct toward the women is relevant but then turned around and cheered on Melania Trump for calling her husband s accusers liars and accusing them of fabricating these allegations for financial and political reasons . In other words , Conway is okay with Melania Trump believing her husband and treating these women like moneygrubbers and liars , but she thinks Hillary Clinton is evil for doing the same thing back in the 1990s ? That s some professional hypocrisy Conway is practicing.Here s the video : The bottom line here is that Bill Clinton is not running for president . Donald Trump IS.Hillary Clinton was First Lady twenty years ago . And she acted as any wife would in defense of her husband . But again , Hillary Clinton has never been accused of sexual assault . Trump IS being accused of sexual assault . But Trump and his team are pretending that Hillary Clinton s conduct toward her husband s accusers is worse than Trump s conduct toward women and that is a false equivalency that should be blown to smithereens the same way Wolf Blitzer torpedoed Kellyanne Conway s whining about equal air time.Featured Image : Screenshot',\n",
       " 'PARIS - Barely six months into office , President Emmanuel Macron is already preparing for his third visit to sub-Saharan Africa . Yet while the energetic young leader is eager to reshape France s relationship with the continent , old problems die hard . His Nov. 28-30 trip to Burkina Faso , Ghana and Ivory Coast is aimed at boosting cooperation on education , the digital economy and the environment . The visit will be capped by an EU-Africa summit in Abidjan , when migration will top the agenda . Africa is not just the continent of migration and crises . It s a continent of the future , the 39-year-old president told French ambassadors in August . But even then , French forces were being sucked deeper into a years-long battle to quell Islamist militancy in Mali . Last month , a raid by French special forces in the Malian desert illustrated how deep that quagmire is becoming . French troops stormed an Islamist training camp , killing 15 suspected militants . French officials said the operation was based on intelligence the camp housed Malians who had joined the Islamists . Mali said government soldiers held hostage by the Ansar al-Dine group were among the dead . As recriminations flew , a defense official spoke of a real trust problem . Laurent Bigot , a former under-secretary in the French foreign ministry , was blunt : Mali is a disaster , he said . We re repeating mistakes made in Iraq and Afghanistan . That assessment underlines just how much work Macron faces if he is to strengthen security and migration policy without getting bogged down in costly military ventures . More than 7,000 French troops are already deployed across Africa . Macron will make his first stop in Ougadougou , Burkina Faso , where he will set out his vision for Franco-African relations in his favored style - a speech . Language and tone are critical . French presidents usually make early visits to Africa , but some have misjudged . Nicolas Sarkozy declared the tragedy of Africa is that the African has not fully entered into history . The comment has haunted him . A presidency official said Macron would emphasize education and investing in youth across the continent , themes he has touched on in his first six months in power . In Ghana , a former British colony where France has ramped up investment , including in oil , telecoms and technology , Macron is to promote the digital economy and a broadening of French education initiatives . In Ivory Coast , environment will be the main topic , before EU and African leaders meet to discuss security and migration , with both Macron and Germany s Angela Merkel keen to limit the flow of migrants to Europe by introducing tighter checks and controls on African soil , not in Europe . Macron s proposals to bolster African growth and create jobs echo Germany s call for a Marshall Plan for Africa . He also promises to raise France s aid budget from 0.38 percent of national income to 0.55 percent by 2022 . After French colonialism ended in the 1950s and 60s , France wielded a tight grip over its former dominions , using military might to install leaders in return for French companies securing lucrative contracts a policy dubbed Francafrique . But French diplomats say the days of France throwing its weight around for commercial favors are over . Macron , born months after Djibouti became the last French colony to gain independence , has shown little inclination to revive the old networks that linked French businessmen and intelligence agents with African politicians . We have a president who has never known the colonies and never had those close links to the region s leaders . He has more freedom to say what he thinks , said one diplomat . Macron has created an African Presidential Council to help shape his thoughts . Its 11 members are mostly young , dual-national entrepreneurs with backgrounds in art , media , finance and ecology . It reports directly to the president , irking some in diplomatic circles . France s shift away from Francafrique has eroded the privileges once enjoyed by companies such as Total , Orange and Areva , just as globalization has opened the field to China and India . French business group Medef is lobbying Macron for a greater role for the private sector in his vision for Africa , although some acknowledge French companies face huge competition and can still suffer an image problem . Africa is a fast growing continent , business opportunities are not a problem , said Patrice Fonlladosa , president of Veolia Africa & Middle East and head of Medef s Africa committee . The problem is being chosen as the partner of choice .',\n",
       " 'SHANGHAI - Chinese police said late on Tuesday some claims of child abuse at a Beijing kindergarten run by New York-listed RYB Education were unfounded , the latest twist in a case that has sparked outrage throughout China . RYB s shares plunged 38.4 percent last Friday after police launched an investigation into allegations of child abuse at the school , though they have recovered some losses this week . By 1700 GMT , the shares were up around 16.6 percent . Police in Beijing s Chaoyang district said in a statement posted on their official microblog late on Tuesday that they had criminally detained a teacher surnamed Liu suspected of using knitting needles to discipline children . However , they added that claims made by some parents that children had been fed unidentified tablets at the school and accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported medical check-ups on unclothed students were fabricated . China s state-run Xinhua news agency had reported last week that police were checking allegations that children were reportedly sexually molested , pierced by needles and given unidentified pills . The Chaoyang police added they had recovered 113 hours of footage from the school s surveillance system , but had not yet found on it instances of people harming children . They added that the hard drive storage for the footage had been damaged . The fall-out from the scandal has been widespread . China s education ministry has launched a special investigation into kindergartens nationwide , while Beijing authorities have said they will send permanent inspectors to city nurseries . RYB , which says it has over 1,300 play-and-learn centers and nearly 500 kindergartens in around 300 cities in China , has suspended one teacher and fired the headmaster of the Beijing kindergarten . The Chaoyang police said it would continue with its investigation to get to the bottom of the child abuse claims and hand out severe punishments according to the law .',\n",

We should carefully consider whether our election system , our election process , is critical infrastructure like the financial sector , like the power grid , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said . There s a vital national interest in our election process , so I do think we need to consider whether it should be considered by my department and others critical infrastructure , he said at media conference earlier this month hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.DHS has a vital security role in 16 areas of critical infrastructure and they provide a model for what the department and Johnson could have in mind for the election.DHS describes it this way on their website : There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets , systems , and networks , whether physical or virtual , are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security , national economic security , national public health or safety , or any combination thereof . A White House policy directive adds , The federal government also has a responsibility to strengthen the security and resilience of its own critical infrastructure , for the continuity of national essential functions , and to organize itself to partner effectively with and add value to the security and resilience efforts of critical infrastructure owners and operators . At the time , Johnson did not mention specific security issues , but the FBI has since cited one hack and another attempt.Johnson also said that the big issue at hand is that there isn t a central election system since the states run elections . There s no one federal election system . There are some 9,000 jurisdictions involved in the election process , Johnson said . Washington Examiner',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump s inner circle is shattering as we speak . Not only has White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned , but not even Trump s legal team is happy with him . And if there s one group of people Trump shouldn t want to p * ss off right now , it s his lawyers . Unfortunately , Trump isn t very smart.The New York Times has just confirmed that Trump s legal team is up in arms over the fact that Trump wants to go after special counsel Robert Mueller . In an interview with MSNBC , Times reporter Peter Baker stated that Trump s legal team was actually trying to convince Trump to leave Mueller the hell alone , as he s highly respected among Democrats and Republicans . MSNBC Nicole Wallace asked : I know nothing is sacred with this man , but do you sense anyone around him is trying to pump the brakes on the character assassination of Bob Mueller ? Baker revealed that some of Trump s legal advisers have already walked out on him due to Trump s attack on Mueller . Baker said : People around him definitely are . This is , in fact , connected to the other thing you were talking about , the sort of blowup of the legal team . some of the lawyers told him don t go after Robert Mueller . First of all , this guy is a good guy , he is a smart guy , a person of integrity . In fact , some of the lawyers have said to the president , in effect , if you didn t do anything wrong and we think you don t have anything to worry about in terms of the Russia investigation , then you should want Robert Mueller at your special counsel , because if he finds that , if that s his conclusion , it will have credibility on both sides of the aisle , so don t do that . And this could cost Trump far more than his lawyers . Baker remarked that Mark Corallo had already resigned from his position as spokesman and communications strategist for Trump s legal team due to Trump . Baker said : He thought that Robert Mueller was a person of integrity and that they shouldn t be attacking him . So this is a point of stress within the Trump team .

       " 'OSLO - A survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and the leader of the group that won this year s Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday urged the United States and North Korea to tone down their rhetoric and negotiate together to avoid a nuclear strike . Tensions have risen markedly in recent months over North Korea s development , in defiance of repeated rounds of U.N. sanctions , of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States . A missile test last week prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea s leadership would be utterly destroyed if war were to break out . The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests . The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons ( ICAN ) was awarded this year s Nobel Peace Prize by a Nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons by countries like North Korea and the growing risk of an atomic war . Graphic of Nobel laureates : tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW Setsuko Thurlow , an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima bombing on Aug. 6 , 1945 , and Beatrice Fihn , ICAN s executive director , will receive the prize together on Sunday at Oslo City Hall in front of King Harald and Queen Sonja . No human being should suffer what we suffered , Thurlow , who was 13 at the time of the attack and is now an ICAN campaigner , told reporters on Saturday . I deeply and strongly urge the leaders of North Korea and the U.S. never to use nuclear weapons ... Negotiate . A diplomatic solution is the only solution . ICAN s Fihn said that the risk of a nuclear war had increased over the past year . There is an urgent threat right now , she told reporters . I would very strongly urge the leaders ( of North Korea and the U.S. ) to back down from their very dangerous rhetoric . Stop threatening to use weapons of mass destruction . Engage in a diplomatic solution . ICAN is a coalition of grassroots non-governmental groups in more than 100 nations that began in Australia . It has campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , which was adopted by 122 nations in July . It needs to be ratified by 50 states to come into force . So far only three have done so : the Holy See , Thailand and Guyana . The treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms , which include the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France , as well as India , Pakistan and North Korea . Israel is also widely assumed to have nuclear weapons , although it neither confirms nor denies it . The U.S. , Britain and France are sending second-rank diplomats to the award ceremony , which Fihn said was some kind of protest .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Former CIA Director James Woolsey , a vocal advocate of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq who promoted allegations that Saddam Hussein harbored illegal weapons , will serve as a senior national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , the campaign announced on Monday . Woolsey ’ s hiring contrasted with Trump ’ s repeated assertions that he was a stalwart opponent of the invasion , although he initially supported it . In the announcement , Woolsey said he supports Trump ’ s plan to expand the U.S. military , which calls for ending Pentagon budget caps and spending billions of dollars for additional troops , ships and aircraft . “ Mr . Trump ’ s commitment to reversing the harmful defense budget cuts signed into law by the current administration , while acknowledging the need for debt reduction , is an essential step toward reinstating the United States ’ primacy in the conventional and digital battlespace , ” Woolsey said . Woolsey , who served for two years as CIA chief under then-President Bill Clinton , also criticized the presence of classified information in emails stored on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s private server . In an appearance on CNN , however , he called Trump ’ s plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States “ a bad decision. ” He also has warned about the threats posed by climate change , something Trump has called a hoax that benefits China . Woolsey was an outspoken proponent of the Iraq invasion , suggesting that Saddam was hiding nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs from U.N. inspectors . He also promoted the erroneous allegation that the Iraqi dictator backed al Qaida ’ s Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . Shortly after former President George W. Bush took office in 2001 , Woolsey visited Britain on a Defense Department trip in a fruitless hunt for evidence that Saddam masterminded the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York . He made a second visit to Britain for the same purpose shortly after Sept. 11 , and again came up empty . At the time of his second trip , Woolsey was a member of the Defense Policy Board , a panel of outside advisers to the Defense Department that advocated Saddam ’ s overthrow even in the absence of any evidence of his complicity in 9/11 . The following year , he arranged for the Defense Intelligence Agency to debrief an Iraqi defector who claimed that Iraq had mobile biological-warfare laboratories disguised as yogurt and milk trucks . The man was later determined to be a fabricator . In 2000 , Woolsey briefly served as a corporate officer of a foundation that managed U.S. funding for the Iraqi National Congress , the exile group that produced a series of defectors who peddled false information to bolster the allegations that Saddam was hiding illicit weapons programs . No such weapons or facilities have ever been found .',\n",
       " 'Normally mild mannered George Takei is pissed at gun violence in this country , and he s planning to organize an LGBT army to do something about it.In an op-ed in The Daily Beast , the former Star Trek star and current Facebook sensation is beyond upset about the brutal massacre at the Pulse gay club in Orlando , Florida that left 49 dead and more than 50 injured . Takei , and many in the LGBT community , took the attack personally . Why wouldn t they ? It was a terrorist attack , but it was also a very specifically targeted hate crime . It was an attack on all LGBT people . Takei argues that they were not the only community targeted , though . Nearly every casualty was also Latino . Those two communities is where Takei sees opportunity .. Takei , a liberal , was very fair in his assessment , but he argues that the Second Amendment is in direct opposition to the First Amendment , especially in situations like mass shootings.For the average American , it is the First Amendment that articulates many of our most basic and fundamental civil rights : freedom of speech and of worship , but also of assembly and association . On Sunday , the latter two rights came under direct assault for the LGBT community . There is little doubt , for instance , that the killer targeted his victims out of hate . He intended to strike not just at people , but at a closely-knit community . After all , if his goal were sheer bloodshed and horror , Orlando boasts far more tempting and , some might even argue , more sympathetic targets . The killer apparently had issues with gay people ; his father stated that , two weeks prior , his son got very angry at the mere sight of two men kissing in public , and even angrier that his own boy should witness it . At the same time , the killer was known to frequent the very establishment he attacked , suggesting that he may have deeply internalized the hate he heard from religious extremists.Takei didn t give ISIS a pass . He mentioned that they hate gay people and that the shooter claimed allegiance with the terrorist organization , but the fight to stop gay marriage and the fight to criminalize bathroom usage by transgender people pretty much shows that our attitudes aren t much better.Takei goes on to say that freedoms , even those guaranteed by the Constitution , have limits : But this is not so rare a circumstance . Indeed , there is no freedom within the Bill of Rights that is absolute . Even freedom of speech , a bedrock of our participatory democracy , has some established limits . I may not jokingly yell fire inside a crowded theater , precisely because the value of that speech is heavily outweighed by the danger to others who might panic . Nor may I cavalierly libel others without fear of legal repercussions . This is because we have decided , as a society , that the cost of the injuries that might arise outweighs any benefit from the freedom to say whatever I want.Takei is done with the gun debate . He has no desire to get rid of the Second Amendment , but he sees no reason everyday American should have assault rifles . He s ready to take on that fight , with a little help from his friends and he feels the LGBT community has spent the past several decades getting ready : Now this latest and most deadly attack has targeted a group that has spent the last few decades learning how to organize , fight for , and protect its rights . Perhaps , then , the next chapter of LGBT history might not be just about the struggle to gain equality for ourselves , but also how we might help lead this country towards a collective right to participate and live free of fear and terror , and ultimately toward a common-sense , permanent ban on weapons designed for mass slaughter.Like it or not , this history and this obligation have been thrust upon us , and we must now rise to its challenge . For if there is one group in this country with more will , more experience , and more tenacity than the NRA , it is the LGBT community.You don t want to mess with us.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic with Getty Images .',\n",

Pyongyang ’ s latest missile launches and the assassination in Malaysia of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ’ s estranged half-brother have added urgency , driving home the need for Washington to confront the security challenge .

They added a consensus was forming around relying for now on increased economic and diplomatic pressure – especially by pressing China to do more to rein in North Korea - while deploying advanced anti-missile defenses in South Korea and possibly in Japan , as well . Among the other possibilities , one U.S. official said , was returning North Korea to the U.S. list of countries that support terrorism . That would be a response to the suspected use of nerve gas to kill Kim ’ s brother at a Malaysian airport last month . It would subject Pyongyang - already heavily sanctioned by the United Nations and individual states , so far to little effect - to additional financial sanctions that were removed when it was taken off the list in 2008 . For now , U.S. officials consider pre-emptive military action far too risky , given the danger of igniting a regional war and causing massive casualties in Japan and South Korea and among tens of thousands of U.S. troops based in both allied countries . Such ideas could gain traction , however , if North Korea proceeds with a threatened test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States . Just before he took office in January , Trump tweeted : “ It won ’ t happen ! ” when Kim said North Korea was close to testing an ICBM . Trump also could opt for escalating cyber attacks and other covert actions aimed at undermining the North Korean leadership , a U.S. government source said . The review is expected to be completed by the end of the month , officials said . Decisions could be held up , however , by the slow pace at which Trump has been filling national security jobs . Trump is known to have little patience for detailed foreign policy discussions , but officials said he seemed to have heeded a warning from his White House predecessor , Barack Obama , that North Korea would be the most urgent international issue he would face - so much so that he requested intelligence briefings on the issue . While officials have stressed the need to persuade China to do more to pressure North Korea , Trump ’ s first concrete response to North Korea ’ s missile tests has been to start installing an advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea , which has incensed Beijing . Diplomats said the move might reassure U.S. allies but could backfire by antagonizing China , which regards the system as a threat , and make it less willing to step up sanctions on its neighbor . “ You have to adjust and calibrate all the options based on the facts on the ground , ” said an administration official , who added that media reports highlighting military options were overblown . “ The ability to have sanctions that pack some punch and are more dynamic than we have had in the past is going to be dependent to some extent on Chinese cooperation , ” he said . Chinese diplomats argue that Beijing is doing all it can . Bonnie Glaser at Washington ’ s Center for Strategic and International Studies said China could close banks that conduct illicit financial transactions with North Korea , prosecute front companies facilitating business , cut off oil exports and expel North Korean workers . Glazer said she saw no good military option . While past talks have failed , she would not be surprised if Trump wanted to try diplomacy . One idea could be to discuss a freeze in North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile programs , which would fall short of current demands for nuclear disarmament . “ North Korea may insist on being recognized as a nuclear weapons state as a precondition , in which case the U.S. would have to decide whether to make that concession , ” she said . Evans Revere , a former senior diplomat who dealt with Korea under President George W. Bush , said Washington should pressure North Korea with sanctions , military deployments and covert operations . “ Doing this would ... compel the regime to rethink its course and make it more likely to return to dialogue and denuclearization , lest it risk collapse , ” he said . Whether Trump will be willing to tolerate the level of risk needed to make such a strategy work remains unclear . “ This is an administration that is more inclined to be averse to regime change than previous administrations , ” the first administration official said . “ That ’ s from the top down. ” “ This administration intends to come up with options based on the cards we are dealt ; not try to change the deck entirely , which is what regime change is . ”',\n",
       " 'N DJAMENA - Chad has rejected allegations made in the United States that its President Idriss Deby was paid a $ 2 million bribe in exchange for providing a Chinese energy company with oil rights without international competition . The United States announced charges on Monday against former Hong Kong Home Secretary Chi Ping Patrick Ho and former Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Gadio for allegedly funnelling bribes to high-level officials in Chad and Uganda . The government is indignant and questions this fierce attack against our head of state , Chad s government said in a statement late on Wednesday , adding that Deby had always sought transparency in the country s natural resources sectors . The U.S. Justice Department said Gadio had received $ 400,000 from Ho via wire transfers through New York to act as a go-between for bribes to Deby on behalf of an unnamed energy firm headquartered in Shanghai . Neither Ho nor Gadio , who were both arrested last week , have commented publicly on the allegations against them . Landlocked Chad pumps about 130,000 barrels of oil per day . It ranks third-from-bottom on the U.N. Human Development Index and 159th out of 176 countries on Transparency International s Corruption Perceptions Index .',\n",
       " 'TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s coalition is on track for a roughly two-thirds majority in Sunday s general election , a survey by Kyodo news agency showed , as its conservative rival led by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike appeared to lose momentum . Japanese go to the polls on Sunday to elect representatives for the country s 465-member lower house , the more powerful of Japan s two-chamber parliament . The Kyodo poll , conducted by telephone between Oct. 15-17 , showed Abe s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) poised to win about 280 seats in the 465-member lower house . Combined with its junior coalition partner Komeito , it is likely to retain about two-thirds of the seats , Kyodo said . The ruling bloc held a two-thirds super majority before the chamber was dissolved for the snap election . About two-fifth of voters polled were still undecided , suggesting they could still sway the results , it said . The Party of Hope , which Tokyo Governor Koike launched last month as a reformist , conservative alternative to the LDP , has lost momentum since the previous survey , Kyodo said . The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan ( CDPJ ) , formed this month by liberal members of the Democratic Party , is set to beat out the Party of Hope to become the leading opposition party , at least doubling its representation , Kyodo added . A corporate survey published on Wednesday showed Japanese companies overwhelmingly want Abe s coalition to stay in power but also want it to lose seats , suggesting they want political stability but don t want to hand him a landslide victory .',\n",

       " 'BAGHDAD - Iraq on Sunday urged foreign countries to stop importing crude directly from its autonomous Kurdistan region and to restrict oil trading to the central government . The call , published in statement from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office , came in retaliation for the Kurdistan Regional Government s plan to hold a referendum on independence on Monday . The central government s statement seems to be directed primarily at Turkey , the transit country for all the crude produced in Kurdistan . The crude is taken by pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for export . Baghdad asks the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil , the statement said . The Iraqi government has always opposed independent sales of crude by the KRG , and tried on many occasions to block Kurdish oil shipments . Long-standing disputes over land and oil resources are among the main reasons cited by the KRG to ask for independence . Iraqi Kurdistan produces around 650,000 barrels per day of crude from its fields , including around 150,000 from the disputed areas of Kirkuk . The region s production volumes represent 15 percent of total Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production . The KRG aspires to raise production to over 1 million barrels per day by the end of this decade . Kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil companies such as Genel ( GENL.L ) , DNO ( DNO.OL ) , Gulf Keystone ( GKP.L ) and Dana Gas ( DANA.AD ) . Major oil companies such as Chevron ( CVX.N ) , Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) also have projects in Kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage . However , Rosneft , Russia s state oil major , has lent over $ 1 billion to the KRG guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $ 4 billion to various projects in Kurdistan .',\n",

       " '( This Sept 8 story corrects headline , clarifies timing of request in paragraph 3 . ) By Fanny Potkin and Michael Martina LONDON/BEIJING - Britain s Cambridge University Press has rejected a request from its Chinese state-owned importer to block online access in China to scholarly articles from the American Political Science Review . A request was indeed made by the Chinese importer , but was not acted upon by Cambridge University Press , so no content was blocked , a spokeswoman for CUP said in an emailed statement . CUP later clarified that the request had been made early last month . China s State Council Information Office told on Friday that importers of foreign publications must verify that the products are legal . In August , CUP , the publishing arm of the elite Cambridge University , reversed a decision to block online access in China to several hundred articles and book reviews in the China Quarterly , a leading academic journal on Chinese affairs that has been published since the 1960s . It said it had blocked the articles , which covered sensitive topics including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests , the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and Tibet , in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in China . Academics called the decision an affront to academic freedom . The State Council Information Office , responding by fax two weeks after a request for comment , said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law . All publications imported into China s market must adhere to Chinese laws and regulations . Publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications , it said , without mentioning CUP .',\n",

He is a legend in his own mind , and an orange , narcissistic , shitfaced demagogue to those of us who can still think.That s not all , though . The book also carries its own description on the back : Drawing upon exclusive interviews and exhaustive research , political analyst David King has compiled a complete and brilliantly accurate account of Donald Trump s virtues and qualities . This is a refreshingly different biographical masterpiece . If you didn t already know what this was , you might want to burn this book in protest . However , it s worth at least one look , given that King and his blank pages freely admit that Trump has absolutely no redeeming qualities worthy of our respect , admiration and trust.Does Trump actually deserve our respect ? Our admiration ? There s a difference between the Office of the President and the person who s occupying said office . Trump has done nothing to earn either . He claims credit for things he hasn t done , like consumer spending during the Christmas season . He s come under fire for sexually assaulting women . He s blatantly racist.And so on , and so forth . There s not a reason in the world that anyone with two brain cells rubbing together should respect and admire Trump.As for trust , all we could ask when we first saw the title was , Really ? But this book , with page after page of absolute nothingness , addresses that , too . There s no trusting someone who lies about literally everything , not to mention claims he s the only person in the known and unknown universes who can solve our problems.Of course , some will see this as a publicity stunt , or a way of exercising the old adage , A fool and his money are soon parted .

       " '- Some influential U.S. senators are urging a federal agency to take action to ensure more children are tested for lead poisoning , citing a investigation that found millions are missing required lead tests , leaving some vulnerable to lifelong health effects . In a three-page letter to be sent on Friday , U.S. senators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio , Ron Wyden of Oregon and Deborah Stabenow of Michigan , all Democrats , called on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , to re-evaluate its lead screening policy for millions of Medicaid-eligible children . The senators want CMS to improve U.S. blood lead testing rates they called “ dismal , ” and to ensure all state Medicaid programs comply with testing rules and provide treatment for children with elevated blood lead levels . Medicaid is a U.S. government program that provides health care for low-income and disabled people . The letter , provided to by Brown ’ s office , cites a June investigation ( reut.rs/1YgbjCX ) detailing how millions of U.S. children are falling through the cracks of early childhood lead testing requirements . Though Medicaid has long required children in the program to receive blood lead tests at ages one and two , obtained data from nearly a dozen states showing that only 41 percent of Medicaid-eligible children were tested as required in 2014 . Those shortfalls left some children vulnerable to prolonged and preventable lead exposure , which can stunt their cognitive development and cause permanent mental and physical ailments . Concerns about childhood lead exposure have grown sharply after children in Flint , Michigan were poisoned by lead-tainted drinking water starting in 2014 . Across the country , more than 500,000 U.S. children have elevated lead levels , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Another exposure risk is old lead paint in millions of homes built before 1978 . In Cleveland , Ohio , for instance , 13.7 percent of children tested had elevated levels of lead in their blood , found . “ Children in Ohio are being poisoned by their own homes , ” Senator Brown said on Thursday . “ To protect our children , we need better coordination between federal and state health agencies and Medicaid physicians. ” Experts cited several factors for the gaps : some doctors do not order the tests or are unaware of Medicaid and state rules ; children miss appointments or parents do not follow up on test referrals ; and Medicaid and health departments do little to enforce testing . The testing guidelines are often confusing , and federal and state data on lead testing contain gaps . In the letter , the lawmakers urge CMS to take steps to get more children tested and to review and update its lead screening protocols , and help guide state Medicaid administrators to make sure all at-risk children get screened .',\n",

       " 'CLEVELAND - As Republicans spilled into Cleveland on Monday to nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate , 2012 nominee Mitt Romney had an equally crucial task : Entertaining his grandchildren at his lakeside summer house in New Hampshire . U.S . Senator John McCain of Arizona , the 2008 Republican nominee who has endorsed Trump despite the latter ’ s insults , attended an ice cream party with his wife , Cindy , and volunteers in his re-election campaign in Prescott , Arizona . He also took part in a veterans ’ gathering . “ Working out of my office in Miami this week , ” former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in February , said in an email to Reuters . Bush had been the most active in attacking Trump on the campaign trail and has said he will not be voting for either Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 . His brother , former President George W. Bush and father , former President George H.W . Bush , were also not at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . These are some of the big names from a long list of prominent Republicans who are not venturing this week to Cleveland , where Trump is to be formally nominated on Thursday after a rough-and-tumble Republican primary fight that ripped wounds in the party that have yet to heal . Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters the convention is a “ healing time ” for the party and that Republicans will leave Cleveland united , but he criticized Ohio Governor John Kasich for not participating in an event in his own backyard . And Republicans have moved past the Bush era , he added . “ They ’ re part of the past . We ’ re dealing with the future , ” he said . Kasich , a one-time rival of Trump ’ s for the nomination , is making the rounds in Cleveland without endorsing Trump or speaking at the convention , a snub that Manafort told NBC ’ s “ Today ” show is “ embarrassing the state ” of Ohio . Kasich adviser John Weaver shot back : “ Governor Kasich has made it clear why he hasn ’ t endorsed Mr. Trump . They share a different world view in how to move the country forward. ” Some of the party ’ s best diverse talent was missing from Cleveland or limiting their participation , including U.S . Senator Marco Rubio of Florida , a Cuban-American , and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley , an Indian-American . Many Republicans feel the party is in sore need of more Republicans like Rubio and Haley to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate . As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order , Rubio was in Fort Myers , Florida , talking about how to tackle toxic algae polluting some of the state ’ s waterways . Rubio , who lost to Trump in the primary battle and is running for re-election to the U.S. Senate , is to deliver a short videotaped message to the convention on Wednesday . Haley is to speak at a breakfast for the South Carolina delegation in Cleveland on Wednesday . “ Chairman Reince Priebus asked if Governor Haley would speak at the convention a couple weeks ago . Governor Haley was grateful for the invitation and looks forward to attending the convention , but , as we have said before , she has no plans to speak so she declined the opportunity , ” said her deputy chief of staff , Rob Godfrey . Romney , who has been a prominent voice among the anti-Trump forces , was in Wolfeboro , New Hampshire , with 36 members of his family for their annual summer gathering , a spokeswoman said . Danny Diaz , who was campaign manager for Jeb Bush ’ s presidential campaign , said the convention is missing a chance to show off some of its most talented Republican politicians . “ It speaks to where we are as a party at the moment more than anything else , ” he said . Former Vice President Dick Cheney was in Wyoming helping the congressional campaign of his daughter , Liz Cheney , and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who was talked about as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump , was at home in Palo Alto , California . “ Writing her book about democracy ! ” said her chief of staff , Georgia Godfrey . Some of Trump ’ s former rivals for the nomination are speaking in Cleveland , like U.S . Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , former Texas Governor Rick Perry , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee .

       " 'The investigation into possible collusion between Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia is heating up . On Monday , former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee , along with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper . There were bombshell revelations in that testimony that directly contradicted the accounts regarding the actions and conduct that led to the firing of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn that were told by the White House . Now , as the lies keep being exposed , Trump has gone even further into the arena of attempting a cover-up of the whole Russia deal by firing FBI Director James Comey.Now , it could be argued that Comey had his thumb on the scale for Trump , considering the letter he sent to House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz just eleven days from Election Day that detailed the FBI s intent to re-open investigations into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s private email server . However , now that Comey has testified just last week that there are ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign s possible coordination with the Russian government to fix an election , Comey is out . The White House released the following statement regarding Comey s firing : Today , President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office . President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions . Here is a shot of the entire letter : Trump himself went on to say in a statement : The FBI is one of our Nation s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement . Crown jewel indeed . It s only a crown jewel in their eyes if they show unwavering loyalty to Trump.Considering that Sessions had to recuse himself from any and all investigations related to Russia and the Trump team , this stinks to high heaven . In other words , Team Trump is getting rid of anyone and everyone who would be able to blow the whistle on anything resembling collusion . These people are balls deep in collusion with the Kremlin.This is what a coup looks like , folks . Sessions , Trump , and all the rest are cleaning house in an effort to get rid of anyone who could tell the truth about what REALLY happened to fix the 2016 election in Donald Trump s and Vladimir Putin s favor.This is a developing story .

He intends to run a full-scale candidacy that will shake up the establishment in a profound way .

       " '21st Century Wire says In yet another interesting end of term move , Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence . He is now scheduled to be released in May of 2017 rather than 2045 . Is this a power play against Trump ? A potential call of bluff to Julian Assange , who s said he would turn himself over to the US courts if Obama frees Manning ? Adam Garrie of The Duran brings some interesting analysis to the table in the article below . Adam Garrie The DuranWith less than three days left until he leaves office , Barack Obama has commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning s sentence . Manning was to be released in 2045 but will now be released in May of this year.This surprise move is not the morally courageous move that it may appear to be . Obama , content to leave office sans dignity is clearly making a challenge to Julian Assange who recently challenged Obama to pardon Manning in return for Assange voluntarily traveling to the US to face what some would call justice , but anyone would a brain would call a show trial.Although I am personally happy that Manning will be released early ( why the delay though ) , my sincere advice to Julian Assange is to do the following : With Donald Trump in power it may be possible to strike some sort of bargain whereby Assange can receive safe passage to Ecuador or any other country willing and able to grant him unconditional asylum . This would have to be guaranteed by President Trump.If Assange fights this battle from within the United States , elements of the deep state or worse yet , rogue agents working on behalf of the deep state or anti-Assange political interests , could take matters into their own hands.In another kick of the political football , Obama has now put yet another problem on Donald Trump s White House doorstep what to do if Assange makes good on his promise ? The best thing that could possibly happen is for Assange to negotiate safe-passage out of Britain , brokered by a Trump administration . If anyone thinks the absurd charges in Sweden could impact this , they do not realise who has pulled the strings all along in this matter.If my suggestion is brought on board , Trump can tell his pro-Assange grassroots supporters ( think Ron Paul followers and Infowars listeners ) that he did the right thing regarding Assange . At the same time , he will be able to tell his deep state and Congressional opponents that he acted pragmatically rather than ethically in order to move on from the Assange problem instead of dragging out in a kangaroo court . Absurd though it is , some American politicians would sooner praise a pragmatic decision vis- -vis an ethical one.In any case , Manning won t be free until May of this year and a lot can happen Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE US NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire US NewsSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'Steve Bannon , Donald Trump s new campaign CEO , is the former chairman of the radical alt-right media company Breitbart . On Sunday , Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter and former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella explained that the site is the de facto SuperPAC of Donald Trump . The two , along with former NPR CEO , Ken Stern explained the significance of the merger.Stelter begins the segment by describing the political merger as Trumpbart . We could call it a political merger , Trumpbart . This week , GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway became the new face of Donald Trump s campaign , appearing all across TV . But it s Steve Bannon who may be the new inner voice of the campaign . Until Tuesday , he was the executive chairman of the far-right website Breitbart . On Wednesday , he became the Trump campaign s CEO . Stelter asks Bardell to describe Breitbart to people who may not be familiar with the media site . Bardell responds , saying : I think you look at it as the de facto SuperPAC of Donald Trump . And really for the last year , year and a half in the Republican primary , they have been the rapid response arm of the Trump campaign . Anytime anything , Bardell says before being interrupted by Stelter . Rapid response arm of the Trump campaign ? Let s underscore that You re saying it s even , what , further to the right than Fox News ? Oh my gosh , it s not even a they make Fox News look like MSNBC , Bardella clarifies . I think that any time that there was a controversy , something that Trump may have said that was generating headlines , Breitbart was the first destination that you could go to to see in real time what the Trump line of thinking was . It was the most sympathetic voice for Trump , and anytime that anyone in the mainstream media would in any way , characterize , or attack , or question Trump s tactics , they were the place that you could go to for that sympathetic ear for Trump . This merger comes at an odd time for the Trump campaign it might end up being Breitbart that benefits from the merger . Trump has already tried and failed to pivot to the center multiple times on his most controversial positions . Having Bannon on board his campaign is only going to make that task that much more difficult . Breitbart , on the other hand , has a spokesman who they can use to make whatever reactionary conspiracy they might have go mainstream.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - As Donald Trump moves closer to clinching the Republican presidential nomination , he has offered lavish praise for Bernie Sanders , who faces increasingly slim chances in his battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race . Trump has begun calling for Sanders to run as an independent if he does not win the Democratic nomination and said he may borrow talking points from Sanders ’ speeches criticizing Clinton to use in a possible matchup with the former secretary of state in the Nov. 8 general election . “ He said some things about her that were so incredible – incredible – and so incredibly bad , ” Trump said on Tuesday after sweeping five Northeastern primaries , adding Sanders had “ been telling the truth. ” Yet data and interviews with Sanders supporters suggest that winning over large numbers of them may be difficult for the New York billionaire businessman . Even though Trump , 69 , and Sanders , 74 , a U.S. senator from Vermont , emphasize some common themes such as criticism of Wall Street and international trade agreements , there is only limited crossover appeal between the two candidates , according to Reuters/Ipsos data . Among voters who back Trump , just 12 percent said Sanders would be their second choice if Trump were not in the race , only slightly higher than the 7 percent who said Clinton would be their next pick . Sanders supporters were even less willing than Trump backers to consider crossing over . Just 8 percent of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Trump as their second choice , roughly the same as the portion of voters who listed Trump ’ s Republican rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich as their second choice . Sanders supporter Joseph Hayes , 37 , of Oregon , still has hope for his candidate . But if it comes down to Trump or Clinton , Hayes said it was an easy , if unpleasant , choice . “ I would have to vote for Hillary . Reluctantly so , but I would , ” he said . People who outwardly back both Sanders and Trump are even more of a rarity . Donor rolls show just over two dozen voters willing to support both Trump and Sanders financially . “ I think Bernie Sanders is too poor to be bought , and I think Donald Trump is too rich to be bought by special interests , ” said Royce Gourley , a real estate investor , who gave $ 2,500 to Sanders and $ 2,700 to Trump , Federal Election Commission filings show . But Trump could find an opening as both he and Sanders have gained strong followings among voters looking for an outsider candidate who will shake up the Washington establishment . Both have made significant inroads among laborers and union members who support their opposition to U.S. trade agreements , including the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which critics say threaten U.S. jobs . But the two are far apart on many issues , especially immigration . Trump has proposed building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country . Sanders has called such proposals “ crap ” and often criticizes what he calls “ inhumane ” deportation programs . For Sanders supporters like Dave Berry , 62 , of Tacoma , Washington , the wooing may pay off as voters weigh the decision to stick with their party or stir things up in Washington . “ I will probably put a check in Trump ’ s column ( in the general election ) , ” Berry said of a possible Trump-Clinton general election contest . He said he did not think the former reality TV star could win , but felt good about making Clinton uneasy about her prospects of securing an easy win . One risk for Clinton is Sanders voters who may sit out the election or choose a third-party candidate if their favorite is not on the ballot . Valerie Benson , 80 , of Cleveland , said that if it came down to Trump against Clinton , “ I don ’ t know that I would vote for anybody then . ”',\n",
       " 'Yesterday , Trae Crowder , otherwise known as the Liberal Redneck , released an awesome YouTube comedy segment celebrating the demise of Ted Cruz.After his devastating loss in Indiana on May 3 , Cruz solemnly resigned from the republican presidential primary race . While a few of his supporters booed at the announcement , the overwhelming majority of Americans were anything but sad to see Cruz drop out.Crowder devoted a short segment to the topic , beginning his monologue by announcing that everyone s favorite murder-lizard has dropped out of the race . He goes on to recite the story of how Ted Cruz came to run for president , explaining : The Cruz family spent hours praying about about whether or not he should run , until god came down and spoke to his wife directly and said he should . Continuing with the story , he says and so Ted hit his knees and offered himself up and said I m your servant lord , use me in this as you see fit . Now that Ted has admitted that there is no possible way he can ever become president , Crowder surmises what this means , saying : To Ted , the use that his lord picked out for him was to completely destroy the republican party as we know it , while getting dusted by a carny-handed mango man . It s comedy , but the Liberal Redneck makes some great points in the segment , honing in on the message that Cruz s abject humiliation sends to right wing Christian extremists.That message is clearly ya ll have lost . Crowder points out that Cruz could not beat a guy who could come out tomorrow and announce Hulk Hogan as his running mate . But the ultimate message sent to the Christian right by Cruz s butt- spanking is that we re done with this . Crowder sums it up by saying : We re done with you wasting our time on trivial bullshit like laws about who uses what bathroom and how gay a cake s allowed to be before you got ta call a prayer circle . We re done . Watch the video below , courtesy of Liberal Redneck via YouTube . Featured image via video screen capture via Trae Crowder on Youtube',\n",

He has asked to be removed as the president ’ s pick to head the U.S. bank regulator , citing family-related issues . “ It is ... with a sense of regret that I have asked the White House to withdraw my nomination . I did so after concluding that the family-related obligations that prompted me to leave government service earlier this year - which have grown more challenging in the interim - are incompatible with the demands of leading an important federal agency like the FDIC , ” Clinger said in a statement . Clinger , who spent two decades as a Republican staff member of the House Financial Services Committee , was nominated for the post in June . His withdrawal is a setback for the Trump administration , as the president has said his top priorities include easing rules on the banking sector to spur economic growth . The FDIC chairman plays a key role in supervising banks as well as determining if large financial institutions have credible “ living wills , ” detailing how they could be taken apart in a financial crisis . Martin Gruenberg , the current FDIC chairman who was appointed by President Obama , plans to serve until his term expires in November . Before leaving the committee in November , Clinger had served as the committee ’ s chief Republican counsel since 2007 , and his time as a staffer to the panel going back to 1995 . He spent two years serving as a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department from 2005 to 2007 . Shortly after Clinger was nominated , a senior administration official touted his extensive experience with banking policy in a briefing call with reporters , while describing him as a pragmatic and well-informed policymaker .',\n",

Thanks to the Liberty Institute for fighting the battles for conservative Americans . Great job ! The U.S. Constitution allows a large Latin cross to stay as the centerpiece of the Bladensburg World War I Veterans Memorial , a federal court in Maryland ruled Monday.In 1925 , the American Legion erected the Bladensburg cross as a memorial honoring 49 men in Prince George s County , Maryland , who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in World War I.But in 2014 , the American Humanist Association attacked the memorial , filing a lawsuit against the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission . The atheists argued to the federal district court that a memorial in the shape of a cross violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution , which forbids the government from establishing an official religion.Liberty Institute , the largest law firm in the country that focuses exclusively on religious freedom , took up the case and intervened on behalf of the American Legion , which became a full party to the case . Liberty Institute then brought in a top global law firm , Jones Day , to lead the case , with Noel Francisco as lead counsel.Today , U.S. District Judge Deborah Chasanow ruled in favor of the American Legion , and against the American Humanist Association.In her 36-page opinion , the Clinton-appointed Chasanow held that while a Latin cross is a symbol often associated with Christianity , it does not violate the Constitution in this context .

       " 'WASHINGTON - Members of the U.S. Congress took the field for their traditional Republicans vs. Democrats baseball game on Thursday , with many wearing hats to honor Representative Steve Scalise , who was critically wounded by a gunman as his Republican team practiced a day before . When the members of the Republican team were announced at Nationals Park , mention of Scalise ’ s name drew a standing ovation from the areas designated for Republican , Democrat and nonpartisan fans alike . President Donald Trump did not attend but in a video address shown on the stadium ’ s giant screen praised the friendly nature of the annual charity event . David Bailey , a Capitol Hill police officer who was part of Scalise ’ s security detail and helped bring down the shooter , also was injured in the Wednesday incident but had recovered enough to throw the game ’ s ceremonial first pitch . The Democrats won the game , 11-2 , but loaned the trophy to the Republicans until Scalise is better . Both Republican and Democratic leaders at the game encouraged a sense of unity in the wake of the shooting during an otherwise politically rancorous time in Washington when the parties are sharply divided over healthcare legislation and investigations of the members of the Trump administration . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stood side by side to shout : “ Let ’ s play ball ! ” and the crowd chanted “ U-S-A ! U-S-A ! ” as the game began . Scalise , 51 , a Louisiana Republican who is the No . 3 House Republican , remained in critical condition at a hospital a few miles from the stadium after undergoing a third surgery on Thursday . He was hit in the left hip , suffering injuries to internal organs , broken bones and severe bleeding , in Wednesday ’ s shooting . For the game , which began in 1909 , members of the Senate and House of Representatives donned uniforms representing teams from their constituencies , and many topped them with hats from Louisiana State University , Scalise ’ s alma mater , as a tribute . In addition to Scalise , a police officer , a congressional aide and a lobbyist were shot on Wednesday morning when a man opened fire as the Republican lawmakers practiced for the game in the Washington suburb of Alexandria , Virginia . Nearly 25,000 tickets were sold for the game and it was on track to raise more than $ 1 million , roughly double what it did last year , organizers said . Ticket sales picked up after Wednesday ’ s shooting , eventually setting an attendance record , the organizers said , as attendees such as Alexander Hilten , 16 , of Arlington , Virginia , decided to come to the game for the first time . “ A lot of times in politics we have divisions but it shouldn ’ t come to violence , ” he said . “ It ’ s cool that they ’ re putting it on even after the shooting . It just shows how resilient these politicians are. ” The Capitol Police Memorial Fund was added to the list of charities that will receive money raised by the game in honor of two members of Scalise ’ s security detail who were at the Wednesday practice session and returned fire . The Washington Nationals Dream Foundation , the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Literary Center are the game ’ s other beneficiaries .

According to court documents made public on Friday , a member of Trump ’ s presidential transition team , later identified by sources as Trump ’ s son-in-law Kushner , told Flynn on Dec. 22 to contact officials from foreign governments , including Russia , to convince them to delay the vote or veto the resolution . Flynn spoke with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak that day , and again the following day , according to the court documents . Also on Dec. 22 , Trump discussed the resolution with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi . Egypt withdrew the text from a council vote the same day . The 1799 Logan Act bars unauthorized private U.S. citizens , which Trump , Flynn , and Kushner all were at the time , from negotiating with foreign governments . However , only two Americans have ever been indicted for allegedly violating it – in 1802 and 1852 – and neither was convicted . Abbe Lowell , a lawyer for Kushner , did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Friday about Israel or other issues . A SECOND GO-ROUND After Egypt withdrew the resolution , its co-sponsors , New Zealand , Malaysia , Venezuela , and Senegal , put it forward again for a Dec. 23 vote . In Washington , Kushner was in contact with Britain ’ s Darroch , and Flynn spoke with Kislyak - lobbying to delay the vote or veto the resolution . A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the council ’ s five permanent members - China , Britain , France , Russia , and the United States - to be adopted . Russian U.N . Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , who died in February , signaled to colleagues behind closed doors on Dec. 23 that he was unhappy with the haste with which the draft resolution was being put to a vote , but he did not ask for the vote to be delayed , diplomats said . Flynn also tried to speak to Malaysian U.N . Ambassador Ramlan Bin Ibrahim , but Ibrahim did not take the call . He also called the Uruguayan U.N. mission , eventually getting through to Deputy Ambassador Luis Bermudez – who was the charge d ’ affaires - minutes before the vote .',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says What this latest result proves is that the level of institutional criminality in Washington DC is so deeply entrenched that American Congressmen are not fit to govern not even in a progressive democracy , much less a constitutional republic.How can they claim to be the world s moral leader and global police when history demonstrates that over the last 40 years the United States has been the world s number one state sponsor of terrorism ? Once again this week , the US was caught helping ISIS by providing air cover for terrorist operations on the ground in Syria.Despite all of this , Donald Trump still remains clueless as to how it all works By Matt AgoristFor the last several decades , the US government has openly funded , supported , and armed various terrorist networks throughout the world to forward an agenda of destabilization and proxy war . It is not a secret , nor a conspiracy theory , America arms bad guys.Given the insidious history of the American empire and its creation and fostering of terrorist regimes across the globe , it should come as no surprise that the overwhelming majority of politicians would refuse to sign on to a law that requires them to Stop Arming Terrorists . And , that is exactly what s happened.H.R.608 Stop Arming Terrorists Act was introduced by Rep. Gabbard , Tulsi [ D-HI ] on January 23 of this year . The bill doesn t have any crazy strings attached and its original cosponsors are a mix of Republicans and Democrats highlighting that it transcends party lines . For years , our government has been providing both direct and indirect support to these armed militant groups , who are working directly with or under the command of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS , all in their effort and fight to overthrow the Syrian government , Gabbard said in an interview earlier this year.The text of the bill is simple . It merely states that it prohibits the use of federal agency funds to provide covered assistance to : ( 1 ) Al Qaeda , Jabhat Fateh al-Sham , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) , or any individual or group that is affiliated with , associated with , cooperating with , or adherents to such groups ; or ( 2 ) the government of any country that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) determines has , within the most recent 12 months , provided covered assistance to such a group or individual.The only thing this bill does is prohibit the US government from giving money and weapons to people who want to murder Americans and who do murder innocent men , women , and children across the globe . It is quite possibly the simplest and most rational bill ever proposed by Congress . Given its rational and humanitarian nature , one would think that representatives would be lining up to show their support . However , one would be wrong.After nearly 5 months since its introduction , only 13 of the 535 members of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors . What this lack of support for the bill shows is that the federal government is addicted to funding terror and has no intention of ever stopping it.To add insult to treason and murder , Senator Rand Paul [ R-KY ] introduced this same legislation in the Senate . He currently has zero cosponsors.Given the overwhelming lack of support for a bill that simply asks the government to stop giving money to people who behead children and video it , it should come as no surprise that Donald Trump signed hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons deals with other countries who also fund these people.As Americans bicker over Trump s bogus and non-existent Russian scandal , he s signing a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars with the largest state sponsor of terror in the world ensuring decades of future wars and the continuation of the cycle of terrorism.What s more is the fact that less than one week after publicly reprimanding Qatar for terrorism , President Trump signed off on the sale of $ 12 billion in weapons to the country he referred to as a funder of terrorism . This move , in Trump s own stance , makes him a de facto funder of terrorism now READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire ISIS FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",

       " 'Many people have looked to Donald Trump s son-in-law , Jared Kushner , to be a moderating influence on the erratic behavior of his father-in-law . This is largely true , but there s just one problem : From sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday , Kushner observes Shabat , as he and his wife and children are Orthodox Jews . That means that Trump is left unattended with people like Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and political operative Stephen Miller influencing his every move and appealing to his worst instincts.This seems to be the reason that some of Trump s biggest , most controversial and bumbling moves have happened on weekends because these are things far-right extremists like Bannon and Miller are all for , while Kushner never would have allowed them to happen if he could help it . According to a source close to the situation , the timing of these blunders is no coincidence . Here are just a few items that have occurred in Kushner s absence : And of course , we re less than two weeks into the Trump presidency , so who the hell knows what is coming next ? Well , it seems that Kushner is not happy with any of these developments at all . He is reportedly increasingly uneasy at the influence of far-right extremists like Miller and Bannon on Trump in his absence . Further , it seems that there is an intense power struggle within the White House , and Kushner seems to be losing . He is incensed at that development as well . He spent copious amounts of time setting up a call between Trump and Mexico s president , only to have Trump blow the whole thing up by impulsively tweeting that he should not meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto if there would be no wall payment . According to Vanity Fair , Kushner was , quote , fucking furious . In short , Trump is taking his marching orders from Bannon and Miller , and not Kushner , and that isn t good for anyone . Kushner might be a rich , slimy sell-out , but at least he seems to be able to control Trump s worst instincts . Now that said control seems to be badly slipping , we should all be very afraid.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Niraj Srivastava 21st Century WireIt is barely seven weeks since Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States . Perhaps too early to figure out the details of America s foreign policy during his presidency . However , some broad contours of his policies are taking shape , which may provide pointers to what he is likely to do in the next four years.These pointers are based partly on what Trump said during his election campaign and partly on what has happened since he became President . Actually , quite a lot has happened in the last seven weeks or so , including considerable turbulence in US domestic and foreign policy.Before proceeding further , it may be useful to recall that Trump s victory in the Nov. 2016 elections was unexpected . Most opinion polls and the mainstream media ( MSM ) predicted victory for Hillary Clinton , who was the candidate of the US Establishment and the Deep State ( DS ) , which includes the military-industrial complex , the intelligence agencies , the MSM , Wall Street , and the Jewish Lobby.The DS is a permanent , unelected , group of institutions , lobbies , and individuals which wields enormous power from behind the scenes and continues to do so irrespective of who is the President and which party controls the US Congress . It is driven by the quest for money and power , among other things.The present DS began taking shape almost thirty-five years ago when Jimmy Carter was President . There was a DS before that too , going back to the 1950s , which came into existence after the Second World War . However , it was much less powerful and entrenched than the present one . John F. Kennedy tried to defy it but did not succeed . Some believe he paid for it with his life.The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 speeded up the consolidation of the current DS , which found that there was nobody to restrain the military power of the US . America could do what it liked . The 1990s also witnessed the emergence of a group of individuals known as the neoconservatives , or neocons , who believed in using the American military for global domination , irrespective of international laws or institutions , such as the UN.The first military adventure of the neocons was the illegal NATO bombing of the then Yugoslavia in 1999 , which was carried out without UN approval . It resulted in the disintegration of the country . Russia was too weak to counter it militarily . Having gotten away with it , the US and NATO embarked upon a series of wars in the next fifteen years , aimed at regime change in countries whose leaders were not US allies.Thus , the US and its NATO allies invaded Iraq in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussain , bombed Libya and killed Qaddafi in 2011 , intervened in Syria in 2011 to oust President Bashar al-Assad , effected regime change in Ukraine in 2014 , and are currently involved in a very destructive war in Yemen along with Saudi Arabia.The US has therefore continuously been at war during the last fifteen years . Some of these wars are still continuing , with no end in sight . It is estimated that the US has lost more than 5000 soldiers and spent around US $ seven trillion to fight these wars . Tens of thousands of US soldiers have been injured , straining the social and economic fabric of the country.But these wars have also greatly benefited elements of the Deep State , who have made enormous amounts of money by selling weapons and other material needed to fight wars . Follow the Money is a useful dictum to identify these elements , for whom continuous warfare has become a way of life . And to sustain that , a powerful enemy is required.It is here that Russia comes in . Since Putin came to power in 1999 , Russia has slowly but steadily nursed its economy and military back to health . Russia s resurgence has upset the neocons and other members of the DS , who had gotten used to unfettered use of American military to invade countries and overthrow regimes , as mentioned above.It was not a coincidence that Russia , and Putin personally , were strongly demonized by the DS during the US presidential campaign in 2016 . Russia was accused of all types of subversion , including hacking the Democratic National Committee emails , hacking the elections themselves , and supporting Trump . Hillary Clinton s campaign theme was that Trump was a Russian agent.What is noteworthy is that not a shred of credible evidence was provided by Clinton or anyone else in the DS to support the above allegations . What was provided included fake news , unsubstantiated dossiers , and rumours . They failed to impress the voters , and Trump won the election by a comfortable margin.But the matter did not end there . Humiliated by the defeat of its candidate Hillary Clinton in the election , the DS has launched a campaign to undermine Trump s presidency , by promoting Russophobia and by portraying Russia and Putin as a threat to US security.It was necessary to provide the above background in order to interpret Trump s foreign policy moves since he took over as President . His policies relating to some major countries and issues will be analyzed.RussiaFirst , Trump s approach to Russia . During his election campaign , Trump had repeatedly said that he would work to normalize relations with Russia . He implied that Russia was not an enemy of the US , and could become a partner to find solutions to problems in certain countries.In particular , Trump said that the US and Russia could jointly fight the ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria . He suggested that since President Assad was also fighting the ISIS in Syria , dislodging him , or regime change , was not a priority.Trump s attitude to Moscow flew in the face of what Hillary Clinton and the DS had been saying for a long time that Russia was an enemy which had to be deterred by overwhelming military power . Trump s detractors , therefore , could not accept his Russia Policy . They had to make sure that he did not abandon their hard line towards Moscow.They did so by targeting Gen. Michael Flynn , Trump s National Security Advisor ( NSA ) . On 9th Feb. , the Washington Post carried a story claiming that Flynn had spoken on the phone to the Russian Ambassador to the US before Trump s inauguration , and discussed US sanctions against Russia with him . It was also claimed that Flynn lied about the conversation to Vice President Pence.Under intense media and Congressional pressure , Trump asked Flynn to resign , which he did on 13th Feb . The Deep State had claimed its first victim and shown Trump what it could do if he deviated from its Russia Policy . Though Flynn had not violated any US law and done nothing to compromise US security , he had to resign because Trump could not stand up to the DS and buckled under pressure.But that was not the end of the matter . On 2nd March the Washington Post carried another story stating that Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions had spoken twice with the Russian Ambassador in 2016 when Sessions was a Senator and failed to disclose the same during his confirmation hearings.This time Trump defended Sessions and said he had done no wrong , which was true . Trump even went on the offensive stating that the really important issue was the illegal leaking of secret information by US intelligence agencies to the media , which he asked the FBI to investigate . Trump also alleged on 4th March that President Obama had ordered wiretapping of his phones in Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 election.After the attack on Flynn , Trump had realized that the final target of the DS was Trump himself . Flynn s removal was the opening salvo , and the attack on Jeff Sessions was the second . Trump reluctantly accepted that he had to fall in line with the agenda of the DS on Russia , Syria , Ukraine , and other issues . Otherwise , the DS might try to remove him by impeachment , on charges of treason and conspiring with an enemy state.Trump s changed approach to Russia was reflected in his appointment on Feb. 20 of General H.R . McMaster as NSA , in place of Flynn . McMaster sees Russia as a hostile revisionist power , and does not support normalization of relations with that country . The appointment of McMaster has been widely seen as an attempt by Trump to placate his enemies in the Deep State ; it also reflects his apprehension that if he does not do the bidding of the DS , he might end up like Flynn.Trump has also proposed an increase in the Pentagon s budget by ten percent , amounting to about US $ 54 billion . That is equal to around eighty percent of Russia s entire military budget in 2015 . The US expenditure on defense is about nine times that of Russia . These figures speak for themselves in the context of Russia s purported threat to the US.It is , therefore , safe to predict that Trump will abandon his objective to normalize relations with Russia , at least in public . He will depict Russia as a threat to US security and act accordingly . Thus , in the recent past , US troops have been deployed in Poland , Bulgaria , and Romania , while NATO troops have been sent to the Baltic states all on Russia s periphery . The White House has also asked Russia to hand back Crimea to Ukraine . ChinaSecond , US relations with China . Trump raised Chinese hackles by speaking on the phone to the Taiwanese President soon after he was elected . China protested vigorously , eliciting a dismissive reaction from Trump , who said there was nothing wrong in receiving a congratulatory phone call from the Taiwanese President . China saw Trump s action as undermining the US s One China policy.During his confirmation hearings , US Secretary of State Tillerson said that China s activities in the South China Sea were not acceptable to the US , which will respond if China violates international law in that area . That can not have pleased the Chinese.However , in the recent past , Trump has climbed down by reaffirming the US s One China policy and avoided making statements that could annoy the Chinese . He seems to have grasped China s importance globally , as well as the massive US economic stakes in that country.Nevertheless , it would not be surprising if US-China relations witness turbulence during Trump s tenure in office . China is also a designated enemy of the US Deep State because that helps increase the Pentagon s budget . The more the number of US enemies , the better for the DS.MexicoThird , Mexico . Trump had repeatedly promised during his election campaign that he would build a wall along the US-Mexico border to reduce illegal immigration from that country . What s more , he had also said he would ask Mexico to pay for the wall . Another issue that he had raised was NAFTA , which , according to him , was hurting the US economy , and needed to be scrapped.After assuming power Trump continued to repeat what he had said about the US-Mexico wall . This angered the Mexican President , who cancelled a scheduled visit to the US in end-January 2017 . After that , Trump sent Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly to Mexico on 23rd Feb. for damage control and normalization of relations . It is safe to say , however , that US-Mexico relations under Trump will continue to witness turbulence because Trump is serious both about the wall as well as NAFTA.IsraelFourth , Israel . In his approach to that country , Trump is proving to be even more pro-Israel than Hillary Clinton , who was the candidate of the Jewish lobby in the US . Trump s Israel Policy seems to be driven by his son-in-law Jared Kushner , an Orthodox Jew , whose wife Ivanka , Trump s daughter , converted to Judaism before marrying Kushner . During his election campaign , Trump had said that he would move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington in mid-Feb. 2017 to meet Trump . After their talks , Trump said that he would accept whatever the Israelis and the Palestinians decided between themselves either a two or a one-state solution to the Palestinian issue . This was a significant departure from the official US and UN position on the issue a two-state solution based on the land-for-peace formula.By adopting the above position , Trump effectively washed his hands off the Israeli-Palestinian issue , leaving it to the Israelis to do whatever they liked , and abandoning the Palestinians to their fate . He has also sent a team of US officials to Israel to examine the feasibility of shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , as promised by him.It is likely that during his presidency Trump will allow Israel to do what it wishes in the region , especially regarding the Palestinians , Syria , and Iran . That can not be good for regional security.IranFifth , Iran . During his election campaign , Trump had repeatedly expressed his anti-Iran feelings and criticized the Iran nuclear deal engineered by Obama . On 6th March , Trump imposed a 90-day ban on travel to the US by Iranian nationals . As things stand , it would be safe to say that during his presidency , US-Iran relations will come under strain . His approach to Iran will also affect US policy in Syria.SyriaSixth , Syria . After becoming President , Trump has spoken about setting up safe zones in Syria which Obama had resisted because he did not want greater and direct US military involvement in that country . Trump has said that Syrian refugees should stay in safe zones in Syria , rather than migrating to Europe or America.If Trump insists on setting up safe zones in Syria , significant numbers of US troops will have to be deployed in the country , in addition to the hundreds of US special forces already present in seven or eight bases in northern and eastern Syria . That would also increase the chances of a deliberate or inadvertent confrontation between the US and Russian forces , who are already present in the country.European UnionSeventh , the European Union . Trump has taken steps to reassure the EU that the US commitment to NATO remains strong , though he insists that NATO members should contribute two per cent of their GDP to NATO s budget . Whether he would be able to enforce that remains to be seen . Under Trump , US relations with EU are unlikely to be as close and warm as they were during Obama s presidency . It is no secret that EU members would have been happier if Hillary Clinton were elected.ImmigrationEighth , immigration . Trump has linked his policy on immigration to the prevention of terrorism in the US . On 6th March , Trump signed an Executive Order banning travel to the US for 90 days by nationals of six Muslim-majority countries Iran , Libya , Syria , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen . Ironically , the US has been responsible for launching wars and destabilizing three of these countries Libya , Syria , and Yemen . The travel ban from these countries could not be more hypocritical and unjust.International Trade and GlobalizationNinth , international trade and globalization . Trump has promised to implement an America First policy which may clash with globalization and free trade . Soon after taking over , he scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and blamed NAFTA for migration of manufacturing jobs to Mexico . Trump s top priority during his tenure would be to fulfill his promise of bringing manufacturing jobs back to America . If , in the process , free trade and globalization are undermined , so be it.IndiaFinally , US-India relations . While campaigning , Trump spoke positively about India . The Indian diaspora in the US , particularly some Hindu community groups , organized fundraisers for Trump . He was quoted as saying : I am a big fan of Hindu and India . Under the Trump administration , we are going to be even better friends . In fact , I would say we are going to be the best of friends . There won t be a relationship more important to us . Trump phoned Indian Prime Minister Modi five days after he was sworn-in as President , and described India as a true friend and partner in addressing the challenges of the world . However , Trump s protectionist approach to trade may pose some problems for India , particularly regarding the H-1B visas , which are used by Indian software companies to send technical personnel for jobs in the US . It is possible that Trump may reduce the number of the visas or impose more stringent rules to obtain them . India has conveyed her concerns to the US side through various channels , and can not do more than wait and see what Trump finally does . But it seems clear that he will give high priority to relations with India.This is how Trump s foreign policy looks at the moment . It is still early days , and things may play out differently . Only time will tell what actually happens . * * * Niraj Srivastava is a former Ambassador of India who has served in several countries including Syria , Libya , Saudi Arabia and the United StatesREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Trump FilesREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'From the amazing Ann Corcoran s Refugee Resettlement blog : Ho hum ! Another of those Somalis we are still bringing into America as refugees at the rate of 800-900 a month has been indicted in Columbus , the city second only to Minneapolis as a city being colonized by a large population of Somali Muslim refugees ( thanks to those religious non-profits hired by the federal government to place them ! ) .This latest jihadist came here as a child and your tax dollars helped raise him ! ( I ll have more tomorrow , just wanted to get the news out while it s hot ! ) Stay tuned A 23-year-old resident of Columbus , Ohio , who trained with a group affiliated with al Qaeda has been arrested and charged with plotting an attack on American soil , the Justice Department revealed today.Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud , a naturalized American citizen of Somali descent , had been instructed by a cleric to return to the United States and carry out an act of terrorism , the indictment said.The Justice Department stated that Mohamud was also an Islamic State sympathizer , and that his brother , Abdifatah Aden , was killed fighting with the group in Syria in 2013.According to court documents , Mohamud left the US a year ago with the intent to go to Syria and train with a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.In April 2014 , he purchased a one-way ticket to Greece , but during a layover in Istanbul he failed to board a connecting flight to Athens and instead made his way to Syria.Once he reached his destination , Mohamud stated that he received training in shooting weapons , breaking into houses , explosives and hand-to-hand combat.The 23-year-old Columbus man aloes said that after completing his training , a cleric with the group Jabhat al-Nusrah instructed him to return to the US and commit an act of terror.The 23-year-old returned to the US in June 2014 with a plot to attack a military base or a correctional facility , targeting people in uniform , according to court documents . Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States , the papers cited by ABC News indicate . He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style . On Thursday , Mohamud was indicted on one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists , one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization , and one count of making false statements to the FBI.The first two counts , providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization are each crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison.Making false statements involving international terrorism carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.Mohamud was arrested on state charges February 21 , 2015 , and is expected to be transferred into federal custody based on today s indictment.Before Mohamud s brother was killed in battle on or around June 3 , 2014 , the two had exchanged emails discussing the 23-year-old s plans to travel to Syria and fight with Islamic State . In February , Mohamud asked Abdifatah Aden how he could send him money.Later that month , Mohamud was arrested at his Columbus home for allegedly providing a computer tablet an other material support to terrorist organizations abroad.Prosecutor Ron O Brien at the time asked a judge to set Mohamud s bond at $ 1million saying he was a flight risk and posed a threat to public safety.Mohamud s attorney , Sam Shamansky , insisted that his client was not a terrorist and would not flee because he was taking care of his ailing mother in Ohio.Via : UK Daily Mail',\n",

       " 'RICHMOND , Va. - A U.S. federal judge on Thursday upheld a 2013 Virginia law requiring prospective voters to show an approved photo identification before they cast their ballots . The state ’ s Democratic Party had challenged the law , signed by former Republican Governor Robert McDonnell , saying it was politically motivated and intended to deter young and minority voters from turning out on Election Day . “ The court ’ s mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law , but rather its constitutionality , ” wrote U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in his decision . While he noted that the measure created an “ inconvenience ” for potential voters who did not have drivers ’ licenses or other government-issued ID , he said that was not enough to strike it down . “ While the merits of this voter identification law , and indeed all aspects of Virginia ’ s voting regime , can be reasonably debated , it remains true that Virginia has created a scheme of laws to accommodate all people in their right to vote , ” Hudson wrote . Lawyers representing the state Democratic Party said in a filing that the Republican-dominated state legislature passed the photo ID law “ to stall , if not reverse , the growing success of the Democratic Party in Virginia. ” The state argued that ID was necessary to ensure that only registered voters cast ballots and to prevent voter fraud . In 2008 , President Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry Virginia in more than 40 years , in part because of turnout among black , Latino and young voters . Obama carried the state again in 2012 . In the most recent statewide elections , Democrats also swept all top offices : governor , lieutenant governor and attorney general . Moreover , the state ’ s two U.S. senators are both Democrats . Hudson acknowledged that Virginia , a former slave state , has “ an unfortunate history of racial and statutory artifice to hinder black voting. ” The ruling comes a month after another federal judge upheld a similar requirement in neighboring North Carolina . A federal court this week ordered Kansas to register thousands of eligible voters who have been blocked from registering . That ruling resulted from an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents who tried to register to vote through the Kansas Department of Motor Vehicles and had been forced to provide additional documentation of citizenship .',\n",
       " 'By The TRUTH HOUNDIn the words of ABC News anchor David Muir , President Trump s press secretary , Sean Spicer , set off a searing firestorm with rather awkward comments during a press conference comparing Syria s leader Bashar al Assad to Adolph Hitler.On Tuesday , April 11 , Spicer said that even Hitler didn t stoop to using chemical weapons like Assad allegedly did on April 4 . Only two days later , with the facts on the ground still not clear , the U.S. launched a reported 59 cruise missiles at Syria to punish Assad s alleged chemical attack . Spicer clarified , however , that he meant that the sarin gas attributed to Assad didn t exist in Hitler s day , and that Assad used sarin gas in a weaponized-projectile form against his own people , or so it seems.Spicer then apologized , admitting that his Assad-Hitler comparison was an awkward mistake . Yet ABC News wouldn t let it go , saying over and over again that Spicer s highly insensitive comments on Syria trivialized Nazi Germany s gas chambers in WWII . So , the firestorm of controversy , while some Jewish figures complained about Spicer s remarks , came from ABC s own hype , blowing Spicer s brief comment totally out of proportion . Complaints are not necessarily a firestorm , which is a very loaded word.And like usual , big media like ABC , which heatedly equated Spicer s clunky comments with an alleged outright denial of the Jewish Holocaust in the second World War , can t seem to find the real story.THE REAL ISSUES AT HANDMainly , there s still no solid proof that Syria s leader used chemical weapons against his own people . Therefore , it was completely unnecessary for Spicer to compare Assad with Hitler in the first place , because the jury is still out on Assad.When Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky ( R ) tried to explain to CNN that Syrian forces may have mistakenly hit a terrorist-controlled ammo dump that could have contained some kind of gas shells , CNN acted like Massie was a loon . . .Continue this article at The Truth HoundREAD MORE NWO NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire NWO FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'If you thought no one in Washington D.C. was feeling the same way about Donald Trump as you are , think again . Several people within the halls of Congress think he s as illegitimate as you do.In fact , one Congressman , Rep. Ted Lieu ( D-CA ) has gone so far as to create a Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock in honor of Trump.If you visit Lieu s Media Center portion of his official Congressional website , this is what you ll see : lieu.house.govHere s Lieu s statement regarding Trump s violation of Article 1 , Section 9 of the United States Constitution : The second after Donald Trump took the oath of office , he violated the Constitution and continues to do so . The Framers wrote Article 1 , Section 9 of the Constitution to prevent foreign influence over our elected officials . It mandates that no person holding office shall , without the Consent of the Congress , accept any present , Emolument , Office , or Title , of any kind whatever from any King , Prince , or foreign State . While holding office , Mr. Trump will receive by virtue of his continued interest in the vast and global Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents . This is illegal.Trump can stop his illegal behavior by divesting his global business interests or putting them into blind trusts . He refuses to do so . Not only is he violating the law , he is explicitly putting his financial interests and those of his family above the interests of America . Trump is not making America First , he is making America Second.As a Member of the House Judiciary Committee , I will do everything I can to hold Trump accountable . My first action is the creation of a Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock that keeps track of the seconds , minutes , hours , and days that Trump is operating outside of the law . At some point , the Clock is going to catch up to Trump . For now , Trump appears to be taking the position of former President Richard Nixon that when the president does it , that means it is not illegal . How did that work out ? What Trump is doing is illegal and action must be taken to stop it . Either he needs to cut all financial ties completely or he should be forced to resign or impeached and brought to justice as the crook that he so apparently seems to be.Good on Rep. Lieu for taking the first steps in holding Trump accountable . You can t do anything without calling him out on his illegal activity first . Well done.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'All the political buzz right now is whether or not Elizabeth Warren will be Hillary Clinton s vice presidential nominee . The once neutral Massachusetts Senator has now passionately endorsed Clinton to be the Democratic Party s nominee for President of the United States , and women s groups are ecstatic at the thought of a two women ticket.But what s more significant isn t that a Clinton-Warren ticket would be comprised of two women , it s that it would be comprised of two former Republicans coming together to usher in one of the most progressive party platforms this country has ever seen.Clinton , who was a Goldwater girl and a Republican until 1968 , and Warren , a Republican until 1996 , both had their reasons for leaving the GOP and joining the progressive movement . Clinton let over her opposition to the Vietnam War , and the party s veiled racist messages at the 1968 Republican National Convention ( these veiled racist messages would later be known as the Southern Strategy ) .Elizabeth Warren , on the other hand , who is roughly the same age as Clinton , stayed in the GOP for a lot longer , but realized ( coincidentally , during the Clinton Administration ) that they were nothing but a bunch of frauds suckling at the teat of big money : I was an independent . I was with the GOP for a while because I really thought that it was a party that was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets . And I feel like the GOP party just left that . They moved to a party that said , No , it s not about a level playing field . It s now about a field that s gotten tilted . And they really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle class American families . I just feel like that s a party that moved way , way away . Two iconic , liberal women . Both former Republicans . Now ? They may be the next President and Vice President of the United States.Compared to Warren ( and indeed Sanders ) , Clinton is certainly the more moderate one . But that doesn t mean she isn t a progressive in her own right , fighting for the rights of women and children for decades and standing up to lobbies that want to turn back the clocks . Clinton s compassion for working families , coupled with Warren s watchdog zeal for the big banks , seems to make us forget they started with conservative backgrounds.It s interesting how that works . From humble , conservative backgrounds to being the front page news on the cusp of history as Democrats.Some conservatives cow tow to the elites , like the so called Reagan Democrats , and others wake up one day , look around , and realize that the system isn t working anymore . So they become Democrats , and fight to make the country a better place.While the Democrats have ( hopefully ) chosen an evolved ticket , Republicans have nominated a constant flip flopper ; Trump was a Democrat before 1987 ; Republican from 1987 to 1999 ; Reform from 1999 to 2001 ; Democrat again from 2001 to 2009 ; Republican again from 2009 to 2011 ; Independent from 2011 to 2012 ; and is now a Republican , again.These two ladies had what s called a natural progression . Trump ? He s seen opportunities to benefit him and only him.With Warren and Clinton , America gets exactly what they see . With Trump , who knows . But what we do know is this : Clinton Warren chose to become Democrats , and have stuck by that principle for decades . And they may very well be our next President and Vice President.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - New York lawyer George Conway , who had been expected to be nominated to head the U.S. Department of Justice ’ s civil division , has withdrawn from consideration . Conway , the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway , said in a statement received on Friday that he was “ profoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General ” for selecting him to serve in the Justice Department . However , he said , he had concluded that it is “ not the right time for me to leave the private sector. ” Conway had notified the White House of his decision on Wednesday in a letter , according to a person familiar with the matter . A White House spokeswoman referred a request for comment to the Justice Department . A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the withdrawal . “ We don ’ t comment on personnel matters , ” the spokesman , Ian Prior , said in a statement . Conway joins a number of potential hires who have withdrawn from consideration for posts in the Trump administration in recent weeks , including candidates for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after President Donald Trump fired James Comey . It has been increasingly difficult to attract people to work in the administration , reported last month , citing sources . Conway , a Harvard University and Yale Law School graduate , is a partner at the prestigious New York law firm Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz . He has worked on major securities and takeover matters , including a 2010 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court said federal securities laws typically do not apply to conduct in foreign countries . That decision has likely saved companies billions of dollars in potential liability . Conway also has been involved in politically charged cases , including a behind-the-scenes role in the sexual harassment lawsuit that former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones brought against then-President Bill Clinton . That case led to the eventual impeachment of Clinton on charges stemming from his relationship with a White House intern , Monica Lewinsky . Kellyanne Conway was Trump ’ s campaign manager before taking her White House post . The Republican pollster and political strategist has been one of the administration ’ s most visible faces . The Conways , who have four children , just purchased a nearly $ 8 million mansion in Washington ’ s Massachusetts Avenue Heights . Wachtell does not have an office in Washington .',\n",

       " 'JOHANNESBURG - A senior official in South Africa s ruling ANC said on Wednesday the party must act against those involved in corruption , and that the issue was damaging its image . Zweli Mkhize , seen as a potential candidate to replace President Jacob Zuma as African National Congress head at a party conference in December , made the remarks at a mining conference in Johannesburg . Mining executives , bankers and investors have all expressed growing concern about governance in Africa s most industrialized economy . Zuma , who must step down after a general election in 2019 , is the focus of numerous corruption allegations , making the issue a touchstone for those keen to rid the ANC of his influence . Many of the allegations are linked to a slew of leaked emails , which has not independently verified , that point to the Gupta family , business friends of Zuma s , using their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies . Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied allegations of wrongdoing . As a party , we should act on those who are involved ... Those emails have come with a lot of revelations , Mkhize , a straight-talking medical doctor , told the conference . Zuma is also under pressure to establish a commission of inquiry based on a report released last year by an anti-graft watchdog into allegations that brothers Ajay , Atul and Rajesh Gupta swayed the appointment of ministers . If there is a proper judicial commission of inquiry , we should be able to put this issue to rest . This is one of the major issues inside the ANC , said Mkhize , a member of the ANC s Top Six leadership group . Mkhize said the graft allegations around the Guptas - widely referred to in South Africa as state capture - were a concern to the ANC because of their effect on the image of the organization . We do not have something that indicates that the ANC itself is captured , he told Reuters . Mkhize told the mining executives that the ANC was concerned about tensions between the industry and the mining ministry . The sides are locked in a bitter legal battle over revisions to an industry charter , which include raising the level of shares that blacks should own in mining companies . Mkhize has said he is available to be a candidate for the presidency if ANC branches choose him . Speaking to on the sidelines of the conference , he said it was too early to gauge his level of support . The frontrunners are former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma , Zuma s ex-wife and preferred successor , and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa , who has also spoken out strongly against corruption . Analysts have said Mkhize , who hails from Kwa-Zulu Natal , Zuma s home province , could emerge as a compromise candidate .',\n",

       " 'BOSASSO - Musa Bihi Abdi of the ruling Kulmiye party was declared the winner of Somaliland s presidential election on Tuesday , by the election commission of the breakaway region . Situated at the northern tip of east Africa on the Gulf of Aden - one of the busiest trade routes in the world - Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 and has been relatively peaceful since . The region of 4 million people has not been internationally recognized but it has recently drawn in sizeable investments from the Gulf . In the election , Abdi won just over 55 percent of the vote , while opposition leader Abdirahman Iro took nearly 41 percent , election commission chairman Iman Warsame said . Turnout was 80 percent . In a debate before last week s vote , Abdi pledged to boost women s participation in politics and introduce compulsory national service for high school and university graduates . There was no immediate comment from Iro , whose opposition party Waddani had accused Kulmiye of vote-rigging although it has not given evidence . A U.K. government-funded international observer mission said the poll preserved the integrity of the electoral process and concluded irregularities were limited and did not undermine the vote . The former British protectorate broke away from Somalia in 1991 following a bloody civil war . The poll had originally been scheduled for 2015 but was delayed by political spats and severe drought . Analysts say the region enjoys strong ties with neighboring Ethiopia and Djibouti as well as its growing investment from the Gulf . Earlier this year the government agreed to let the United Arab Emirates establish a military base in its port of Berbera . That came after Dubai s DP World last year signed a 30-year concession to develop the same port that will require an investment of $ 440 million . The company is pouring further funds into a project connecting the port to landlocked Ethiopia . This month DP World said it would also develop an economic zone in the region . [ L5N1NC3CC ]',\n",
       " 'Naples , Florida pastor John Gursoy is outraged over new boating regulations in the gated community where he lives . The new regulations include limiting the number of boats that can be parked at one dock and raising the age of boat operators from 13 to 14 . Volunteer board members for the community association also voted to uphold a longstanding ban on two-stroke engines . The new regulations so infuriated the Florida pastor that he went to Kinkos and printed off a Nazi flag.Upon returning home , Gursoy raised the flag on a cherry picker in his yard . He also hung a sign slandering neighbor Peter Rietz , who volunteers his time to serve on the board.The sign reads Peter Rietz Fascist ? Discriminates . Image credit : Naples Daily NewsUpon seeing the display , some members of the Florida community were disturbed enough to call police.Because the flag and sign are on private property , local law enforcement officers say no crime is being committed.When asked about the display by Naples Daily News , Gursoy said : This flag is symbolic of the most discriminatory , selective enforcement of rules ever in the history of mankind . He went on to explain how the boating regulations , which were designed to protect the environment and members of the community where he lives , compare to Nazi Germany , saying it was all that kept coming to my mind . Gursoy told Naples Daily News that he put the sign up as a warning to the community that this is the direction we re going with the current board . Because clearly not being able to park ten boats on a single dock or let a 13-year-old drive a watercraft is just like Nazi Germany all over again . It s very frustrating , Peter Rietz said during an interview with Naples Daily News . My wife is up in arms . Our neighbors are all up in arms . The police have been here . It s obviously in poor taste and reflects on the individual . He added , It s hard to believe how someone who holds himself out as a Christian would behave in this fashion .

Twin Falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the U.S. , where you have people moving in and out of government and the Chamber of Commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor , said Corcoran . Only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the Chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap , overseas labor . These are jobs that Americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from Sudan or Iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week . The local Muslim community in Twin Falls grew out of its mosque and built a new , much larger house of worship last year.Here s Chobani CEO s response to Trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries : This is very personal for me , Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN .

       " 'BISHOFTU , Ethiopia - Hundreds of people chanting anti-government slogans marched in the central Ethiopian town of Bishoftu on Sunday at a religious festival where a stampede triggered by a police move to quell protests killed dozens of people last year . The incident during the annual Irreecha festival in Bishoftu , which lies 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of the capital Addis Ababa , marked the bloodiest period in unrest that plagued the Horn of Africa country for months in 2015 and 2016 . Authorities at the time said 55 had died in the stampede , while dissidents put the toll at around 150 . On Sunday , thousands of people attended the thanksgiving event that marks the end of the rainy season , a majority clad in red , black and white attire - the Oromiya region s flag . Although the lakeside event ended without any violence , anti-government slogans rang out soon after the ceremony began . Down , down EPRDF ! dissidents chanted in small groups as they marched towards the town s centre , referring to Ethiopia s ruling party . Earlier in the week , the regional government announced that police presence would be minimal and that those attending would not hold arms to prevent tensions . The violence in 2015 and 2016 forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was only lifted in August . The unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital Addis Ababa and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuses . It included attacks on businesses , many of them foreign-owned , including farms growing flowers for export .

       " 'BANGKOK - Police in Thailand on Wednesday arrested a woman wanted in connection with a 2015 bombing in Bangkok that killed 20 people , 14 of them foreign tourists . The blast at a central Bangkok shrine popular with visitors from China and elsewhere in Asia raised fears of a spillover of violence from China s western Xinjiang region , where some members of the Uighur Muslim minority oppose Beijing s rule . No group claimed responsibility for the blast that killed five people from mainland China and two from Hong Kong and wounded more than 120 people . The Thai woman suspect , Wan na Suansan , 29 was arrested at Bangkok airport , said deputy national police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul . He declined to say where she had arrived from . Wan na faced various charges including premeditated murder and co-possession of explosives and weapons , police said . She is one of 17 people wanted in connection with the bombing . After questioning police will send her to prosecutors , Srivara told reporters at Bangkok s national police headquarters . Two ethnic Muslim Uighur men from China were accused of carrying out the bomb attack and are on trial in Thailand . They have denied all charges . Investigators said in 2015 Wan na rented a room in Bangkok to one of those men . She fled the country shortly after the attack . Police ruled out terrorism , saying the bombing was prompted by a crackdown on human smuggling networks . But many analysts and diplomats said it was likely an act of revenge for Thailand s deportation to China of the more than 100 Uighurs in July that year . A relative of Wan na s told reporters at the national police headquarters that Wan na wanted to come back to Thailand to prove her innocence .',\n",

       " 'Table set for thanksgiving in Siem Reap . ( Photo : Andre Vltchek ) Andre Vltchek NEOA table was set up for two , an advertisement table , a table with a photo of a giant turkey , two elegant plates , and a U.S. flag sticking out into the air . Thanksgiving at Angkor Royal Cafe , a flier read . And : 23rd November Join us for a traditional Thanksgiving Feast .This was at one of the international hotels in Siem Reap , a Cambodian city near the world architectural treasures of Angkor Wat and the ancient Khmer capital , Angkor Thom.The same day I read an email sent to me from the United States , by my Native American friends , with a link to an essay published by MPN News , called Thanksgiving Guide : How to Celebrate a Sordid History . It began with a summary : While millions of Americans prepare this week to get into the holiday spirit , beginning with Thanksgiving , how many are prepared to view the day through an accurate lens ? While to many Americans the holiday serves as a reminder to give thanks , it is seen as a day of mourning by countless of others . The truth is : European migrants brutally murdered Native Americans , stole their land , and continue to do so today . The day became an official day of festivities in 1637 , to celebrate the massacre of over 700 people from the Pequot Tribe.In a hotel , I approached a cheerful French food and beverage manager and asked him whether he was aware of what he was suggesting should be celebrated in one of his restaurants ? Oh I know I know , he replied , laughing . It is a little bit controversial , isn t it ? Bit controversial ? I wondered . It appears more like you are inviting people to celebrate genocide , a holocaust , with free flowing wine and a giant turkey . I am trying to see things positively , he continued grinning at me . Then he summarized : So I guess you won t be joining us tonight ? What a pity What a pity , I thought , what a pity . I won t get to eat that famous American pie tonight and turkey and who knows what else , just because I am not eager at all to celebrate the massacres and land grabs perpetrated by the Empire.The manager couldn t help asking : Where are you from ? I knew he would ask . No European would say what I was saying . I m Russian , I replied . Oh I see , he gave me that I should have guessed smile . Russian-American , I added.I m convinced that the French manager has been sincerely oblivious about what I was stating . He is supposed to be oblivious . There are , after all , our genocides , and the genocides of the others . Our genocides , those that we triggered or committed , should never be discussed . Or more precisely , it is extremely impolite to discuss them . Most of the people don t even know about them , including many of the victims . On the other hand , the genocides committed by the others , particularly by adversaries of the West , are widely discussed , publicized , analyzed , inflated and very often even fabricated ( All this described in detail in my 840-page book Exposing Lies Of The Empire ) .Cambodia is the textbook case of the latter . Here , several decades ago , the U.S. and its allies first supported the hopelessly corrupt and brutal government in Phnom Penh , while triggering a monstrous carpet-bombing campaign of the Cambodian countryside , mainly near the border with Vietnam . This was supposed to prevent the country from going Communist , or at least Ho Chi Minh style Communist . Hundreds of thousands of villagers were murdered by the bombing . Millions were forced to hit the road , leaving their dwellings , as the countryside was converted into a giant minefield , covered by unexploded ordnance.Further hundreds of thousands died from starvation and diseases . Furious , mad from suffering , the people of Cambodia rose against the collaborators with the West in Phnom Penh . Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge took the capital virtually unopposed . Recently , deep in the jungle , I spoke to the former Pol Pot s personal guards . I asked them point-blank whether they knew anything about Communism . Nothing at all , I was told . The U.S. was murdering our families , for no reason . Corrupt elites were selling the country to the West . We were all outraged , and ready for revenge . We would follow anybody calling for revenge . However , the West is passing the events , to this day , as a Communist genocide .Rwanda is yet another case of a twisted narrative . I made an entire full-length documentary film Rwanda Gambit on the subject . There , the West turned the history upside down , reducing the entire tragedy into a primitive and easy-to-digest narrative of bad Hutus killing good Tutsis . Yet even the former U.S. ambassador Robert Flatten told me that his country groomed , armed and supported the deadly RPF , mainly Tutsi army , which had been , before 1994 , raiding the Rwandan countryside from neighboring Uganda , burning villages and killing civilians.While a former Australian lawyer and U.N. investigator , Michael Hourigan , supplied me with information about the downing of the plane , which , in April 1994 , killed both the Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira , while on the final approach to Kigali airport . The orders to shoot down the plane were given by the RPF leader Paul Kagame , who was in turn sponsored by the West . This event triggered the terrible bloodletting on 1994 . The next year , in 1995 , the Rwandan army entered the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and participated in the killing of at least 9 million people , mainly civilians , on behalf of Western governments and multi-national companies , making it the worst crime against humanity in recent history.In fact , almost all the major genocides committed by the West or its allies in modern history , are silent ones , including those in Iraq , Syria , Iran , West Papua , East Timor , DRC , Indonesia , Afghanistan , Angola , and dozens of other unfortunate places all over the world.The gruesome genocides committed by the West all over the world , during the last 2,000 but especially during the last 500 years , are never defined as such ; never as genocides . Throughout history , European countries have been destroying , systematically , most of the cultures on all continents of the Planet , enslaving virtually all the non-white nations , plundering and looting its colonies ( read : almost all the non-white nations of the world ) , while exterminating hundreds of millions of men , women and children . The death toll has been rising , accumulating , to near 1 billion , according to the testimony of one of my friends , a senior U.N. statistician.I will return to the Cambodian story soon , on the pages of this magazine . And I will be returning , again and again , to the genocides committed by Europe and North America , virtually everywhere . Unless the history is understood and acknowledged , the world has no future , and there can be no solutions to the terrible problems that our humanity is facing.But for now , let me conclude this brief essay by saying that I did not participate in the consumption of turkey and American pies on Thanksgiving holiday , in the Cambodian city of Seam Reap.My thoughts went to those 700 people from the Pequot Tribe who rebelled , stood firm and died for freedom , almost 400 years ago . These were some of the first fighters against Western imperialism . These were the Americans that I admire , this is America that had been terribly damaged but not yet completely destroyed . No overly sugary , sentimental and empty words could fully choke its essence , as no gluttony and food orgies could ever fully silence the screams of the pain of those who died in the hands of the European invaders , during and after the conquest of what has been so cynically christened as the New World . * * * Andre Vltchek is a philosopher , novelist , filmmaker and investigative journalist .

       " 'WASHINGTON - The White House said on Friday that it would be “ profoundly unwise ” to plow money set aside for Ebola-related projects into research and mitigation efforts for the mosquito-borne Zika virus as several top Republican lawmakers have requested . Democratic President Barack Obama has asked the U.S. Congress for more than $ 1.8 billion to fight Zika in the United States and abroad , and pursue a vaccine . But three key Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have said they think the government should instead draw from $ 2.7 billion that has not yet used for public health projects overseas . The Zika virus has been linked to birth defects in Brazil and spread to at least 31 other countries and territories , mostly in the Americas . Representative Hal Rogers , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , and Representatives Kay Granger and Tom Cole , who are appropriators for Health and Human Services and the State Department , made their request in a letter to the White House on Thursday . “ If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible , it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola , ” the lawmakers said . Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri , a member of the Republican Senate leadership team , said earlier this month that Obama should repurpose Ebola funds for the new Zika fight . But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the unspent Ebola money was needed to “ build up the public health infrastructure of countries overseas ” to help prevent future epidemics . West Africa was stricken by a two-year Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people starting in December 2013 and led to cases in the United States . “ It ’ s critically important that we follow through on those efforts and it would be profoundly unwise to take money away from the ongoing effort that ’ s need to fight Ebola , ” Earnest said . Earnest said that the White House would soon put forward a formal Zika funding request for lawmakers . It will include a plan to redirect some Ebola funds to the Zika fight , but Earnest said new funding was also require . Much remains unknown about Zika , including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly , a condition marked by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems . Brazil said it has confirmed more than 500 cases of microcephaly , and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers . Brazil is investigating more than 3,900 additional suspected cases of microcephaly .',\n",

       " 'The supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are very much like him they live in their own little world , completely unaware of how history and the country has progressed . Thanks to a new poll that was recently revealed on MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show yesterday , we re able to see just how far removed Trump supporters are from reality.According to a recent Public Policy Polling ( PPP ) poll , Trump and his supports rarely have any grasp or knowledge of basic facts that are only a Google search away and they don t really care about becoming informed . Maddow highlighted just how off Trump supporters were regarding some of the biggest issues our country has been faced with , and the findings were truly pathetic.It turns out , almost 40 percent of Trump supports truly think that President Barack Obama has caused the stock market to go down . The truth is , the stock market has DOUBLED during Obama s time in the White House : TwitterAnother thing that Trump and his rabid fans like to whine about is the unemployment rate . Despite numerous reports coming out about how Obama has done wonders for the unemployment rate , 67 percent of Trump lovers are saying it has increased . The truth is that in January 2009 , the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent and thanks to Obama , it is now 4.6 percent as of last month.TwitterTrump voters are also very uninformed about Trump s rival , Hillary Clinton and we can thank Trump himself for that . Clinton s 2.7 million lead over Trump in the popular vote has been broadcast heavily and yet 40 percent of Trump fans are in complete denial and think she lost ! Even worse 60 percent think millions of illegal voters contributed to Clinton s win ( another rumor that Trump is solely responsible for ) .TwitterThis is truly depressing , and shows just how much trouble America is in when Trump begins his term and his clueless followers are given even more reason to ignore facts . These polls show just how gullible Trump voters are and how easily they eat up Trump s weird conspiracy theories and fear-driven rhetoric . They ll believe just about anything he says , and now they re just as far removed from reality as he is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday , seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania , Nevada , Arizona and Ohio , Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a “ campaign of vigilante voter intimidation ” that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan . “ Trump has sought to advance his campaign ’ s goal of ‘ voter suppression ’ by using the loudest microphone in the nation to implore his supporters to engage in unlawful intimidation , ” the Ohio Democratic Party wrote in a legal filing . Similar language was used in the other lawsuits . The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment . Since August , Trump has urged his supporters to monitor polling locations on Election Day for signs of possible voting fraud , often urging them to keep a close eye on cities like Philadelphia and St. Louis that have high minority populations . Campaigning in Ohio , Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Trump was hoping to discourage people from participating in the election . “ His whole strategy is to suppress the vote . Lots of noise . Lots of distractions , ” Clinton said in Cleveland . Democrats are also trying to stop the Republican National Committee from working with the Trump campaign or state parties on poll monitoring , arguing in a separate case that a long-standing court order prevents the national party organization from engaging in “ ballot security ” measures . In a motion filed on Monday in that case , the RNC said it was not involved in poll watching but was working to support Trump in other areas . “ That is evidence of politics , not wrongdoing , ” the RNC said . Many states allow campaigns and political parties to monitor balloting , although they often face restrictions . In Pennsylvania , for example , poll watchers must be formally certified by the local election board and must be registered voters in the county where they are working . The state Republican party has sued to remove those restrictions . With early voting under way , civil rights groups have said they have heard isolated reports of self-described poll monitors photographing voters and engaging in other intimidating behavior . Democrats also sued Republican operative Roger Stone , a longtime Trump ally who is organizing an exit-polling effort . Democrats said the true purpose of the project , called Stop the Steal , was to intimidate minority and urban voters . Stone told that his project was designed to ensure that electronic voting machines were working properly . On Stop the Steal ’ s website , Stone says Clinton ’ s Democrats “ intend to flood the polls with illegals . Liberal enclaves already let illegals vote in their local and state elections and now they want them to vote in the Presidential election. ” Stone said the 1,400 people across the United States who volunteered for the project had been instructed to use neutral language and only approach people after they had voted . “ Since we are only talking to voters after they have voted , how can we be intimidating them ? ” Stone said .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill on Thursday evening that includes $ 10 million to help fund the United Nations ’ climate change body that oversees the Paris Climate Agreement , despite President Donald Trump ’ s decision to stop funding it . The 30-member Senate panel , which allocates federal funds to various government agencies and organizations , approved a $ 51 billion spending bill for the State Department and foreign operations , which included an amendment to continue funding the U.N . Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the scientific body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The amendment passed even though the 2018 budget proposal that Trump , a Republican , introduced earlier this year eliminated support of any mechanism to finance climate change projects in developing countries and organizations . The United States is still a party to the 1992 UNFCCC , which oversees the Paris agreement , although Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the nation from the global climate pact and cease funding the Green Climate Fund , which supports clean energy and climate adaptation projects in vulnerable countries . The United States has usually contributed to around 20 percent of the UNFCCC budget . Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon , the amendment ’ s author , said on Twitter on Thursday : “ Despite @ RealDonaldTrump ’ s dangerous # ParisAgreement decision & unwillingness to act , we can & will fight back to combat # climatedisruption. ” The amendment passed 16-14 . Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee voted in favor , as did all committee Democrats except for West Virginia ’ s Joe Manchin . Although the United States announced it would no longer be a party to the Paris Climate Agreement , a pact that nearly 200 countries approved in 2015 to combat global warming , it has said it will continue to observe the ongoing negotiations . In a diplomatic cable that obtained last month , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said U.S. diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on how the United States plans re-engage in the global Paris climate agreement . The cable also said diplomats should make clear that the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels , which have been linked to global warming . [ L1N1KU0UP ]',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is postponing his trip to Egypt and Israel this week in order to stay in Washington for a congressional vote on President Donald Trump s tax overhaul plan , White House officials said on Monday . Pence had been scheduled to depart on Tuesday night for Cairo . Instead , the trip will be rescheduled for the week of Jan. 14 , officials told reporters . The vice president is committed to seeing the tax cut through to the finish line , said Alyssa Farah , a spokeswoman for Pence . The vice president looks forward to traveling to Egypt and Israel in January . Pence has been a key figure in the Republican effort to overhaul U.S. tax law . He could provide a tie-breaking vote in the Senate if needed , though on Monday it looked like bill has enough votes among Senate Republicans to pass . Pence was to have spent three days in the region with stops in Cairo and Jerusalem , the first high-level official to visit after Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . That decision led to uproar and protest in the region . The status of Jerusalem , which holds Muslim , Jewish and Christian holy sites , is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians , who were furious over Trump s move and have declined to meet with Pence . The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the full city . White House officials said the delay was not related to the reaction in the region to Trump s decision . Two Senate Republican holdouts agreed on Monday to support the tax package . Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the body . The tax vote is still in very good shape , but we don t want to take any chances , a White House official said , adding there were several difference scenarios in which Pence might be needed . The timing of the vote made the trip tricky . The House of Representatives was due to vote first at around 1:30 p.m. ( 1830 GMT ) on Tuesday , according to Republican aides , while the Senate vote is expected to follow either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday . White House officials determined that if Pence could not leave for his trip by Tuesday evening , it would have pushed his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday to a very late hour and left little time to hold meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in Israel before Friday at sunset , when Shabbat , the Jewish Sabbath , begins . We ran into time constraints to get it all done before Shabbat , the official said . Even with the postponement to January , the trip will be overshadowed by Trump s decision on Jerusalem . Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal capital , while Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector , which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally . Pence , an evangelical Christian who planned to highlight the plight of Christian minorities during his trip , was not scheduled to meet with Palestinian Christians or with officials from the Coptic Christian church , who declined a meeting in response to the U.S. move . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also refused a meeting with Pence .',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump has just been screwed over by members of his own party , thanks to his insistence on a border wall that is absolutely pointless and won t actually work.At Congress has been at a standstill over including Trump s border wall in government spending , Republican lawmakers are now agreeing with Democrats by supporting a clean spending bill so the government won t have to stop working on Friday . This push takes Trump s border wall out of the running for funding.Josh Gottheimer ( D-NJ ) said : Ideological litmus tests on a spending bill like this simply create partisan roadblocks . With so many pressing issues facing our country , we need to work together to keep the lights on and avoid another expensive shutdown that weakens not only our economy but our national security . Mick Mulvaney , who is Trump s budget director , tried to make a deal with Congress by promising that Obamacare would get more funding if Trump s wall was funded . Clearly okay with manipulating Americans into funding a wall that no one wants , Mulvaney said : We d offer them $ 1 of CSR [ Obamacare ] payments for $ 1 of wall payments . Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues . No one in the Democratic party actually wants this border wall to be funded and Chuck Schumer pointed out exactly why . These are points that even Republicans can t argue with : A spokesman for Schumer blasted the Trump administration for trying to use Obamacare to bribe lawmakers into funding Trump s wall : The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans , in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.The US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and , according to the President , Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall . If the administration would drop their 11th hour demand for a wall that Democrats , and a good number of Republicans oppose , Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal . Trump needs to just admit that the border wall he promised his brainless supporters was a flawed idea , and it is only going to cost America in the end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images',\n",
       " \"OREGON RANCHERS TAKE A STAND : The feds felt a rancher father and son didn t spend enough time in prison for arson so they ordered them jailed again . Father and son , Dwight and Steven Hammond , were ordered back to jail for burning land in an effort to keep it from endangering their property : CALL TO ACTION : PATRIOT CALL TO ACTION : A Major Storm Is Brewing In Oregon Over Fed Gov Charging Rancher With Terrorism For Insane ReasonHERE S THE LOWDOWN FROM SUPERSTATION95 : The feds , operating outside the law , are trying to jail two men without legal jurisdiction . Instead the tables turned when armed Militiamen seized their federal complex instead ! The Bundy family of Nevada joined with hard-core militiamen Saturday to take over the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , vowing to occupy the remote federal outpost 50 miles southeast of Burns pictured below for years.The occupation came shortly after an estimated 300 marchers militia and local citizens both paraded through Burns to protest the prosecution of two Harney County ranchers , Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond , who are to report to prison Monday.The story could set the stage for a western-style soap opera . I call it as the sagebrush burns , said Erin Maupin of the long and storied history involving the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , special interest groups and the cattle ranchers on the Steens Mountain of Oregon.The latest scene involved two ranchers being sentenced to five years in federal prison for inadvertantly burning about 140 acres of BLM rangeland in two separate fires , years ago . That is an area big enough to feed about three cow-calf pairs for a year in that neck of the woods.Dwight , 73 and son Steven , 46 , admitted in a 2012 court case , to lighting two different fires . Both fires started on Hammonds private property . An August lightening storm started numerous fires and a burn ban was in effect while BLM firefighters fought those fires . Despite the ban , without permission or notification to BLM , Steven Hammond started several back fires in an attempt to save the ranch s winter feed . The back burn fire break worked and protected the Hammond s ranch . BLM firefighters saw the back-burn and called it into their headquarters as an arson . Sadly , wind drove the back-burn onto federal land , on which the Hammonds paid for grazing rights . Despite this , the US Attorney for Oregon prosecuted the two men , saying they committed arson against federal property along with nine other charges . The jury convicted the men of only two charges , starting the fires they readily admitted to starting.Arson against federal property calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years prison . The Hammonds argued that such minimum mandatory sentences were unconstitutional and a judge agreed . He sentenced the two men to LESS than the five years . Not satisfied , the US Attorney appealed and the Ninth US Circuit ordered the District Court to re-sentence the men in accordance with the statute.THE FIRES : The first , in 2001 , was a planned burn on Hammonds own property to reduce juniper trees that have become invasive in that part of the country . That fire burned outside the Hammonds private property line and took in 138 acres of unfenced BLM land before the Hammonds got it put out . No BLM firefighters were needed to help extinguish the fire and no fences were damaged.Dwight s wife Susan shared some crucial details in an exclusive interview with SuperStation95 . They called and got permission to light the fire , she said , adding that was customary for ranchers conducting range management burns a common practice in the area . We usually called the interagency fire outfit a main dispatch to be sure someone wasn t in the way or that weather would be a problem . Susan said her son Steven was told that the BLM was conducting a burn of their own somewhere in the region that very same day , but that they believed there would be no problem with the Hammonds going ahead with their planned fire . The court transcript includes the same information in a recording from that phone conversation.In cross-examination of a prosecution witness , the court transcript also includes admission from Mr. Ward , a range conservationist that the 2001 fire improved the rangeland conditions on BLM.Maupin , a former range technician and watershed specialist who resigned from the BLM in 1999 , said that collaborative burns between private ranchers and the BLM had become popular in the late 1990s because local university extension researchers were recommending it as a means to manage invasive juniper that steal water from grass and other cover . Juniper encroachment had become an issue on the forefront and was starting to come to a head . We were trying to figure out how to deal with it on a large scale , said the woman whose family also neighbored the Hammonds for a couple of years . In 1999 , the BLM started to try to do large scale burn projects . We started to be successful on the Steens Mountain especially when we started to do it on a large watershed scale as opposed to trying to follow property lines . Because private and federal land is intermingled , collaborative burns were much more effective than individual burns that would cover a smaller area , Maupin said.Susan said the second fire , in 2006 , was a backfire started by Steven to protect their property from lightening fires . There was fire all around them that was going to burn our house and all of our trees and everything . The opportunity to set a back-fire was there and it was very successful . It saved a bunch of land from burning , she remembers.The BLM asserts that one acre of federal land was burned by the Hammonds backfire and Susan says determining which fire burned which land is a joke because fire burned from every direction.Neighbor Ruthie Danielson also remembers that evening and agrees . Lightening strikes were everywhere , fires were going off , she said.Maupin said prescribed burns to manage juniper were common in the late 1990s and early 2000s , best done late in the fall when the days are cooler.Prescribed burns on federal land in their area have all but stopped due to pressure from special interest groups , Maupin said . As a result , wildfires now burn much hotter due to a ladder of material on the ground grass , brush and trees . The fires now burn really hot and they sterilize the ground . Then you have a weed patch that comes back . Maupin said planned burning in cooler weather like the Hammonds chose to do improves the quality of the forage , and makes for better sage grouse habitat by removing juniper trees that suck up water and house raptors a sage grouse predator.// < !

       " 'WELLINGTON - South Pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to North Korea after Fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade United Nations sanctions . Fiji , along with Interpol and the Singapore-based regional shipping regulator Tokyo MoU , are investigating the vessels for links to North Korea , a spokesman for the country s Maritime Safety Authority ( MSAF ) told on Friday . Interpol and Tokyo MoU did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations . The 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the Pacific to search for any links to North Korea . New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee said Pacific countries , including his own , were concerned North Korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions . What we do know is that declared North Korean GDP ( gross domestic product ) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country , Brownlee told in a phone interview this week . The move came as the UN on Monday ramped up sanctions on North Korea , including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas . Authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country . UN sanctions introduced in August banned North Korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds . North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $ 295 million from seafood in 2017 , one U.N. diplomat said . In Fiji s case , the North Korean-linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering , the MSAF said . It was not known in what way the possibly more-than 20 vessels were linked to North Korea or what their suspected activities or locations were . The MSAF declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation . In addition to the fraudulent use of flags , Pacific governments were concerned North Korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags . If it s not clear why they re on that register , in other words , they re not regular callers into Pacific ports , then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner , said Brownlee . The review would take place over the next couple of months , Brownlee said , and Australia and New Zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any North Korean connections .',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - Presidential candidate Donald Trump admires the late Douglas MacArthur and George Patton , both World War Two generals . They were winners , unpredictable , and not especially nice guys , he says in campaign speeches . But Trump ’ s pledge to imitate their styles sets modern-day military experts on edge . Although unquestionably in the pantheon of U.S. military heroes , MacArthur and Patton were also controversial figures remembered by historians as flamboyant self-promoters . The commander in the Pacific , MacArthur was eventually fired by President Harry Truman for speaking out against Truman ’ s policies in the Korean War , which followed World War Two . Before Patton died in December 1945 , he questioned the need to remove Nazis from key posts in postwar German politics and society . As Trump edges closer to the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election , he likely will face more pointed questions about the policy ideas behind his sweeping statements . His main Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have offered far more details about their foreign policy visions as has Hillary Clinton , front-runner for the Democratic nomination . Born in 1946 , a year after World War Two ended , Trump often praises MacArthur and Patton for the blunt ways he says they commanded respect . “ George Patton was one of the roughest guys , he would talk rough to his men , ” Trump told an audience last week in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . “ His men would die for him , ” Trump added . “ We don ’ t have that anymore. ” He said Patton would wipe out Islamic State without hesitation were he still in command . But military historians and retired generals say Trump has an inflated view of the two military men and especially their relevance to an era of modern warfare when armies rely more on technology and when battle successes and failures and civilian casualties are communicated far more rapidly than when MacArthur and Patton commanded troops 70 years ago . The candidate ’ s spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump made a habit of citing the two World War Two figures to “ emphasize the need to strengthen the U.S. military , talk less and do more to protect America. ” She declined to comment on the criticisms . She said Trump had consulted military experts , but declined to say how many , who they were or whether they were retired or active . Trump was unavailable for an interview . Interviewed by Reuters , recently retired military personnel voiced doubts about Trump ’ s grasp of U.S. military operations . One retired four-star general called Trump ’ s references to Patton and MacArthur “ bumper sticker foolishness. ” Another said Trump was comparing “ apples to oranges ” by likening America ’ s role in World War Two to the fight against Islamic State . “ He has no understanding of how it works , at least in my view , ” said an aide to a third retired four-star general . “ He makes these bold statements and one-liners , but that doesn ’ t translate into understanding what it takes to be a military leader , what it takes to develop a plan. ” All three criticized as inflammatory Trump ’ s recounting , at a Feb. 19 rally in Charleston , South Carolina , of a myth about World War One General John Pershing ordering the execution of alleged Muslim insurgents in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig ’ s blood , an extra offense to Muslims because Islamic law prohibits the consumption of pork . Trump often says that in the spirit of MacArthur and Patton , he never wants to reveal his specific plans for military operations , since that would give the enemy a chance to prepare and counterattack . “ I don ’ t want my generals being interviewed , ” he said in Myrtle Beach . Trump ’ s statement had an irony about it , given his oft-repeated comment that he knows what military experts have to say from their interviews on television . But historians said the comment also showed he has little understanding of just how often MacArthur and Patton spoke to the press . “ They were the media whores of their time , ” said Daniel Drezner , a professor at International politics at the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University who often writes on national security . He said anyone vaguely familiar with Patton by way of the 1970 George C. Scott film “ Patton ” would know he got into trouble for remarks that were politically controversial .',\n",
       " 'XIAMEN , China - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear missile programme would be counter-productive and said threats of military action could trigger a global catastrophe . Putin , speaking after a BRICs summit in China , criticised U.S. diplomacy in the crisis and renewed his call for talks , saying Pyongyang would not halt its missile testing programme until it felt secure . Russia condemns North Korea s exercises , we consider that they are a provocation ... ( But ) ramping up military hysteria will lead to nothing good . It could lead to a global catastrophe , he told reporters . There s no other path apart from a peaceful one . Putin was speaking after South Korea said an agreement with the United States to scrap a weight limit on its warheads would help it respond to the North Korea threat after Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test two days ago . Russia , which shares a border with North Korea , has repeatedly joined China in calling for negotiations with Pyongyang , suggesting that the United States and South Korea halt all major war games in exchange for North Korea halting its testing programme . While describing additional sanctions as the road to nowhere , Putin said Russia was prepared to discuss some details around the issue , without elaborating . The Russian leader also lashed out at the United States , saying it was preposterous for Washington to ask for Moscow s help with North Korea after sanctioning Russian companies whom U.S officials accused of violating North Korea sanctions . It s ridiculous to put us on the same ( sanctions ) list as North Korea and then ask for our help in imposing sanctions on North Korea , said Putin . This is being done by people who mix up Australia with Austria , he added . The United States has floated the idea of requiring all countries to cut economic links with North Korea to try to strong-arm Pyongyang into changing its behaviour . In Moscow s case , that would mean stopping using North Korean labourers , tens of thousands of whom work in Russia , and halting fuel supplies to Pyongyang . Russia has so far refused to contemplate doing either .',\n",
       " 'SUMTER , S.C. - Donald Trump , who has argued his experience negotiating tough real estate deals makes him best qualified to be U.S. president , said on Wednesday it might be impossible to forge a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians . During a televised town hall session hosted by MSNBC in South Carolina , Trump , the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination , said he believed getting a deal done would be “ very , very tough. ” The remarks were notable not only because Trump rarely discusses Israel or the Mideast peace process on the campaign trail , but also because they seemed to show a shift in Trump ’ s views on the feasibility of a deal . Trump said in December he would start working on a deal between the two sides within the first six months of taking office if elected . In those earlier comments , he also said he thought a deal would be hard to make , but added he thought it depended whether the Israelis really wanted to make one . In his comments on Wednesday , Trump said he ’ d heard from an Israeli that “ the other side has been trained from the time they ’ re children to hate Jewish people , ” and that was why a deal might not work . “ You have one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people , ” he said . “ I would say if you can do that deal you can do any deal , ” he added . “ That ’ s probably the toughest deal in the world right now to make and it ’ s possible it ’ s not makeable. ” The town hall was part of Trump ’ s final push to translate his substantial lead in the South Carolina polls to a victory in the state ’ s Republican primary election , which takes place on Saturday . He also appeared before South Carolina audiences on Wednesday in the towns of Bluffton , Walterboro and Sumter . Trump said he ’ d still try to get a peace deal done , even if the odds for success were slim : “ I ’ m going to give it a shot. ” ( Reporting By Emily Flitter in Sumter , South Carolina ; Editing by Michael Perry ) SAP is the sponsor of this content .

       " 'PARIS - Two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across Paris , France officially ended a state of emergency , replacing it with the introduction of a new security law which critics say undermines civil liberties . The new anti-terrorism law , effective from Wednesday , gives police extended powers to search properties , conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred . Some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance , it is the opposite , French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the Eiffel Tower in Paris . The level of threat is high everywhere in the world , he said , referring to the attack in New York on Tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people . The new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law , although with some modifications . One measure will allow the Interior Ministry , without approval from a judge , to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat , restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area . Conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct . France has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law , Human Rights Watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month . France s human rights watchdog , an independent body , has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of Muslims . The French Council of the Muslim Faith , the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of Muslim religious activities , said it would remain vigilant about the bill s implementation . However , the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far . A poll conducted in early October showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill . The government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks .

       " '- An Illinois law allowing voters in highly populated areas to register to vote at polling places on election day was reinstated on Tuesday by a federal court , pending an appeal of a ruling declaring the statute unfair to people in smaller communities . The state is seeking to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan , which found that the law discriminates against voters in less-populated counties . The law , passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn , allowed election day voter registration for the first time , including at polling places . But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more . The conservative Liberty Justice Center , of Chicago , filed a lawsuit in August , saying the law was discriminatory . Der-Yeghiayan agreed , writing that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts . The state of Illinois appealed the ruling last month , and in their order issued Tuesday , a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the state ’ s request to stay the order until the appeal was adjudicated , court records show . U.S. voters will go to the polls to choose a president , Congressional representatives and other officials on Nov. 8 .

       " 'UNITED NATIONS - The Iran nuclear deal must be changed if the United States is to remain in it , the top U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday , suggesting its key limits on the Iranian nuclear program must be extended . Making his debut appearance at the annual United Nations General Assembly , U.S. President Donald Trump accused Iran of exporting violence , bloodshed and chaos and of seeking to project its influence in Yemen , Syria and elsewhere in a region rife with sectarian conflicts between Sunni and Shi ite Muslims . We can not let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles , and we can not abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program , Trump said . He saved his harshest words for the 2015 pact struck by Iran and six major world powers under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for loosening economic sanctions . The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into . Frankly , that deal is an embarrassment to the United States , and I don t think you ve heard the last of it - believe me , Trump said . His chief diplomat , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , went further , telling Fox News that the agreement must be changed or the United States could not stick with it . Tillerson said the sunset clauses , under which some of the deal s restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire from 2025 , were of particular concern . If we re going to stick with the Iran deal there has to be changes made to it . The sunset provisions simply is not a sensible way forward , he said . It s just simply ... kicking the can down the road again for someone in the future to have to deal with , he added . In contrast , French President Emmanuel Macron praised the agreement during his speech and said it was inconceivable to abandon it . Renouncing it would be a grave error , not respecting it would be irresponsible , because it is a good accord that is essential to peace at a time where the risk of an infernal conflagration can not be excluded , Macron said . The French president said he understood U.S. concerns but thought the way to address them was to open up a negotiation designed to extend limits on its nuclear program beyond 2025 . Macron and other supporters of the accord say weakening or scrapping the deal would add fuel to a regional powder keg and deter North Korea from negotiating on its nuclear program . The July 14 , 2015 accord aims , for a decade , to extend the amount of time it would theoretically take Iran to produce enough fissile material for an atomic bomb - so-called breakout time - from several months to a minimum of one year . Critics of the deal , including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , worry that , once the main restrictions on Iran s nuclear program expire in 10 to 15 years , Tehran will be in a position to quickly develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes . Iran responded angrily to Trump s remarks . Trump s ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times - not the 21st Century UN - unworthy of a reply , Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , Iran s lead negotiator for the nuclear agreement , said on Twitter . The U.S. president must decide by Oct. 15 whether to certify that Iran is complying with the pact , a decision that could sink the deal . If he does not , the U.S. Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal . Netanyahu was also unsparing in his criticism of the nuclear pact , though Israeli officials privately admit that having some restrictions on Iran s program are better than none . Change it , or cancel it . Fix it , or nix it , Netanyahu said in his U.N. speech , saying the most important change was to eliminate the sunset clauses . The Obama administration had said the deal would ensure long-term scrutiny of Iran to deter it from developing a bomb , a view echoed by Macron on Tuesday as he noted its monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) U.N. nuclear watchdog . Trump s pugnacious U.N. speech may empower hard-liners in Iran , who are pushing for global isolation and who discourage already wary foreign investors . His stance , unlike Obama s offer of an olive branch , could serve the hard-liners loyal to Iran s most powerful authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Such Khamenei allies , including Iran s Revolutionary Guards ( IRGC ) , some powerful clerics and influential politicians , are wary of any detente with the West which could imperil the Islamic Revolution and undermine their economic interests . The nuclear deal was negotiated with Iran by the United States , Russia , China , Britain , Germany and France . The six will meet with Iran at the ministerial level on Wednesday .',\n",

       " 'OSLO - Norway s tax-cutting Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg declared victory on Tuesday after a parliamentary election , narrowly defeating a Labour-led opposition with her promises of steady management of the oil-dependent economy . The win is historic for Solberg , whose supporters compare her firm management style to that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , because no Conservative-led government has retained power in an election in Norway since 1985 . It looks like a clear victory , for the center-right , a beaming Solberg told cheering supporters in Oslo just after midnight ( 2200 GMT ) , following Monday s voting . Our solutions have worked . We have created jobs , she said , but warned , We have some challenges ahead . ... Oil revenues are going to be lower . We all must take responsibility . The ruling minority coalition of her Conservatives and the populist Progress Party , together with two small center-right allies , was set to win a slim majority with 89 seats in the 169-seat parliament , according to an official projection with 95 percent of the votes counted . ( Election graphic tmsnrt.rs/2wYkVIO ) It s a big disappointment , opposition Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere said , conceding defeat for his party that has been a dominant force in Norwegian politics for a century . Solberg , 56 , plans more tax cuts as a way to stimulate growth for Europe s top oil and gas producer . Stoere had argued for tax increases to improve public services such as education and healthcare for Norway s 5 million citizens . The oil industry could be affected by the vote , because Solberg will need support from two green-minded , center-right allies to ensure a majority to pass legislation in parliament . One of the two parties , the Liberals , wants strict limits on oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters . Solberg s Conservative Party was set to lose three seats to 45 in parliament , making her more dependent on outsiders help and perhaps heralding a less stable government . And the head of the other small party , the Christian Democrats , warned Solberg he would not automatically back every government decision . We will not give a guarantee for the next four years , party leader Knut Arild Hareide said . They ( The Liberals and the Christian Democrats ) will support Solberg as prime minister , but the question is whether they get a firm agreement or if there is cooperation on a case-by-case basis , said Elisabeth Ivarsflaten , a professor in comparative politics at the University of Bergen . Then it may be a weaker government , she told Reuters . The Norwegian currency , the crown EURNOK= , strengthened slightly following the first projections after falling sharply earlier in the day on weaker-than-expected inflation data . For much of the year , Labour and its allies were favored by pollsters to win a clear victory , but support for the government has risen as the economy gradually recovered from a slump in the price of crude oil , Norway s top export . Unemployment , which a year ago hit a 20-year high of 5 percent , has since declined to 4.3 percent , while consumer confidence is at a 10-year high . Solberg has won credit for the upturn with a no-nonsense style of management . Norway s economy also has the cushion of a sovereign wealth fund worth almost $ 1 trillion , the world s biggest , built on income from offshore oil and gas . Regardless of which government we get , the challenge will be to use less oil money , said Erik Bruce , chief analyst at Nordea Markets . There is broad consensus about the outlook for the sovereign wealth fund and the Norwegian economy , which means a tighter fiscal policy . The sovereign wealth fund has wanted to invest in unlisted infrastructure to boost its return on investment . Finance Minister Siv Jensen has twice said no to the request over the past two years , citing political risk . That stance is unlikely to change now that the government has been re-elected . Labour was set to remain the biggest party in Norway , with 49 seats , just ahead of the Conservatives . Stoere , who sometimes compares himself with French President Emmanuel Macron , took over the leadership of the Labour Party from Jens Stoltenberg , who left Norwegian politics to become NATO s secretary-general . Solberg s coalition partner , the populist Progress Party , has sharply limited immigration to Norway in what Stoere said is a betrayal of Norwegian values . We have done our share of the job . We have delivered , Finance Minister Siv Jensen , leader of the Progress Party , told party supporters as they chanted four more years . Norway s problems are small by the standards of most nations . Apart from its sovereign wealth fund , Norway tops U.N. lists of the best country in which to live , based on issues such as per capita gross domestic product , education and life expectancy . It even rose to first , from fourth , in a 2017 survey that ranked nations by happiness .',\n",
       " 'DUBAI - Yemen s ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh has had a successful operation at a Sanaa hospital after a Russian medical team was flown in to perform it , government sources said on Saturday . The Russian team arrived in Sanaa two days ago and operated on Saleh on Friday for wounds he sustained in an assassination attempt in 2011 . Saleh s General People s Congress Party said the procedure was successful , and that his condition was stable . Saleh was severely wounded in an attack on the presidential palace in Sanaa in June 2011 . He went to the United States for treatment on one occasion , before a travel ban was imposed . The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Saleh in 2014 , accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing Yemen s political process , subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze . Government sources told the Russian team had arrived with approval from the Saudi-led Arab alliance but did not reveal the precise nature of the surgery . Saleh ruled Yemen for 34 years , but was forced from power after pro-democracy protests in 2012 . Forming a surprise alliance with the Houthi movement when they seized Sanaa in 2014 , Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters have weathered thousands of air strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in more than two years of war .',\n",

Besides the pandering to hispanics by using their language she also gives me the creeps when she acts like she s America s grandma . You just know she s not a warm and fuzzy little grandma but a political hack with a shrill voice who s demanding to be crowned Queen Hillary . It s all just so fake Hillary Clinton s clumsy pandering to racial groups , and her campaign theme of portraying herself as America s Grandma-in-Chief , collided in a website post inviting Hispanic voters to think of her as their abuela , or grandmother.The mockery greeting this post # NotMyAbuela isn t the reaction Clinton s campaign was hoping for.The post is entitled 7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela . ( It was originally called 7 ways Hillary Clinton is just like your abuela , but her tone-deaf campaign team hastily changed it after the backlash began . ) Those seven things , as described by the vast army of highly-paid political consultants this particular abuela employs , include : She worries about children everywhere . Because no one else running for President worries about children.She knows what s best . ( This point wins extra creepy totalitarian points by citing Clinton s enthusiasm for climate change as an example of knowing what s best . The climate change movement is increasingly focused on asserting that democracy ends where their theology begins , and unquestioning compliance with their demands is mandatory . ) She reacts this way when people le faltan el respeto . In other words , when people fail to show respect . This probably isn t the right tack for a gazillionaire aristocrat noted for her arrogance to present herself to voters.The Clinton campaign demonstrated how she reacts to people who don t show respect with a GIF of Clinton looking exasperated at a congressional hearing a moment from the Benghazi hearing , perhaps ? Double clueless points for campaign staff if so . Too bad Clinton didn t show the men who died in Benghazi some respect , isn t it ? She reads to you before bedtime .

She isn t afraid to talk about the importance of el respecto ( especially when it comes to women ) . Well , except for women who accuse her husband of sexual harassment or assault , that is . The example of Clinton s soaring respect for women is her lecturing Donald Trump about daring to say he cherishes them , which is pretty weak tea for a woman running as Feminist Numero Uno.She likes to highlight accomplishments .

The five-month battle to retake Marawi from pro-Islamic State rebels left the city in ruins . The government announced the end of military operations on Monday in the country s biggest security crisis in years , allowing rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts to begin .. The teachers taught children and their parents how to recognize live mortar shells , grenades , aircraft rockets and improvised explosive devices in their villages . Security forces used artillery bombardment and air strikes to flush out the gunmen who endured 154 days of the offensive by stockpiling huge amounts of weapons , including bombs . Warnings from the teachers included drawings of inquisitive children hammering bombs and trying to set them on fire . This helps us parents to understand and tell our children not to touch or get near the bombs , said Sobaida Sidic , a housewife attending the training . Authorities said 920 militants , 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict , which displaced more than 300,000 people .

       " 'CLARK FREEPORT ZONE , Philippines - The threat from North Korea has grown to a critical and imminent level and the United States , Japan and South Korea must address the matter , Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told his U.S. and South Korean counterparts in talks on Monday . Onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in Tokyo after North Korean weapons tests , including test firing missiles over Japan , as Pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States . His comments broke from more measured language on Monday by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-Moo , as the three men met on the sidelines of a gathering of Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines . ( The ) threat posed by North Korea has grown to the unprecedented , critical and imminent level . Therefore , we have to take calibrated and different responses to meet with that level of threat , he said , speaking through a translator , at the start of talks in the Philippines . South Korea s Song also acknowledged that North Korea s provocative behavior is becoming worse and worse , in public remarks before reporters were escorted out of the meeting room . Mattis renewed sharp criticism of North Korea s tests , saying they threaten regional and global security . Mattis , who kicked off a week-long trip to the region on Monday , has been eager to emphasize diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully as escalating tension between Washington and Pyongyang stoked fears of armed confrontation . Asked about his conversation with Onodera after the two met earlier in the day , before joining South Korea s Song , Mattis said they discussed maintaining stability and peace in support of the diplomats . Meanwhile , former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said he is willing to travel to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to help diffuse the situation , the New York Times reported . Mattis has been more cautious in his public remarks than U.S. President Donald Trump , who has been locked in a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , threatening to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies . Kim has blasted Trump as mentally deranged . Mattis is at the start of a week-long trip to Asia and will attend meetings hosted by defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) in the Philippines . ASEAN defense ministers , in a joint statement , expressed grave concern over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications . They underscored the need to maintain peace and stability in the region and called for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula . Mattis trip , which will include a stop in Thailand , comes before Trump s first visit to Asia next month , including a stop in China . Trump has been pressuring China to do more to rein in North Korea s missile and nuclear program . China is North Korea s neighbor and biggest trading partner . Mattis , while in the Philippines , said he will commend the military for defeating insurgents in Marawi City on the islandof Mindanao . The Philippines said on Monday it has ended five months of military operations in Marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years . Some experts see the Marawi insurgency as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by Islamic State loyalists to exploit Mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train , recruit and launch attacks in the region . It was a tough fight , Mattis told reporters on his flight to the Philippines , adding he thought the Philippines military had sent a very necessary message to the terrorists . On Thursday , Mattis will lead the U.S. delegation inThailand for the cremation rites for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej .',\n",

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto , 54 , was found with more than 1 kg of methamphetamine in her backpack while in transit in Kuala Lumpur enroute to Melbourne from Shanghai in December 2014 . Under Malaysian law , anyone found guilty of possessing more than 50 grams of illegal drugs is considered a trafficker and faces a mandatory death penalty . The law was amended last month to do away with the mandatory death sentence , allowing judges to use their own discretion . But the changes have not yet come into effect . Exposto s lawyers said she was the victim of an internet romance scam and was lured into carrying a bag containing drugs unknowingly by a friend of her online boyfriend , who claimed to be a U.S. soldier serving in Afghanistan . I agreed with the defense s argument that the accused had no knowledge of the drugs that were in her bag , Judge Ghazali Cha said on Wednesday . Exposto s conduct during her arrest showed she was naive and her behavior was that of an innocent person , he said . The judge referred Exposto to Malaysia s immigration department for deportation . I m happy now that I m free , Exposto said in brief comments to reporters .

He is in the job largely as a bridge to conservative groups inside the House Republican caucus , but he has struggled at times to prevent them from stymyimg the agenda of the Republican leadership . Widely seen as well-liked among colleagues , many paid tribute to him in the hours after the attack . Scalise first went to Congress in 2008 following a decade in the Louisiana state legislature , and quickly ascended into the ranks of party leadership . An ardent supporter of Trump inside the Republican Party , he has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association , a powerful lobbying group that fights for gun-ownership rights . Scalise is popular inside his deeply conservative Louisiana district , which encircles New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain and includes the swampy bayou region where the Mississippi River spills into the Gulf of Mexico . He won re-election in November with 75 percent of his district ’ s vote . Before becoming majority whip , Scalise was chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee , which includes more than 170 conservative lawmakers . In 2014 , Scalise ’ s office confirmed he had addressed a white supremacist group connected to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in 2002 when he was a state representative . Seeking to play down the controversy , Scalise ’ s office said he had spoken to hundreds of groups during his political career and was unaware of the views of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization . Scalise has played shortstop in the annual congressional baseball game , which began more than a century ago and pits Democrats against Republicans to raise money for charity . “ Knowing Steve Scalise as we all do , he is likely really frustrated that he will not be able to play in the baseball game , ” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a speech about the attack from the House floor on Wednesday .',\n",

President Donald Trump ’ s decision to hire Scaramucci less than two weeks ago prompted Spicer to resign in protest . Scaramucci lasted only 10 days in the job . He was fired on Monday after a profanity-filled tirade against then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon . Spicer has since been fielding lucrative offers for his post-White House life and has found them too appealing to forsake , the official said .

       " 'In a speech weighted with America ’ s complicated racial history , Democrat Hillary Clinton laced into Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday , accusing him of fueling divisions among Americans over race and religion . “ His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes , ” Clinton said at a campaign appearance at the Illinois state house in Springfield . “ It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American . It ’ s there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as president. ” Clinton ticked off Trump ’ s proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country , create a database of Muslims already in the country and step up deportations by creating a special deportation force as policies intended to drive Americans apart . She lambasted Trump ’ s decision to re-tweet an image from a neo-Nazi and his statements about women . “ We need a president who can help pull us together , not split us apart , ” Clinton said . The two presumptive nominees are heading into July nominating conventions where they are to formally become the Democratic and Republican candidates who will square off in the Nov. 8 presidential election . Clinton ’ s speech comes a week after a sniper shot and killed five Dallas police officers during a protest of police killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota . She addressed these incidents and other race-related deaths in Springfield . Clinton ’ s speech on Wednesday carried the echo of history . The state house in the Illinois capital of Springfield was the site where President Abraham Lincoln delivered an anti-slavery speech during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1858 , warning that “ a house divided against itself can not stand. ” As the 16th president of the United States , he went on to guide the country through most of the Civil War . Clinton acknowledged that while “ the challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln ’ s time , ” the country ’ s “ long struggle with race is far from finished. ” The Illinois state house is also where President Barack Obama , the first African-American to hold the highest office in America , launched his first campaign for president in 2007 . Trump spent months “ trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black president , ” Clinton said . Trump was loudly fixated on the issue of Obama ’ s birthplace during the 2012 presidential campaign and had also suggested that Obama was a Muslim , despite clear evidence that the president was born in Hawaii and is a Christian . Clinton acknowledged that she has made some missteps on race . She faced early criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement for past statements , such as one in the 1990s , when she was first lady , calling violent minority youth “ super predators. ” She told the Washington Post earlier this year that she “ shouldn ’ t have used those words. ” “ As someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign I can not stand here and claim that my words and actions haven ’ t sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress , so I recognize I have to do better , too , ” she added .',\n",

       " 'KIEV - Ukrainian police recaptured the former president of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on Friday , prompting further protests in central Kiev by his supporters who freed him from police custody earlier this week . The development is the latest twist in a long feud between Ukrainian authorities and Saakashvili , who has turned on his one-time patron President Petro Poroshenko , accusing him of corruption and calling for his removal from office . General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko , who says Saakashvili is suspected of assisting a criminal organization , said the opposition leader had been detained by police and was in a temporary detention facility . As promised , security officers did everything to avoid extreme violence and bloodshed , he said in a post on Facebook . Saakashvili s recapture follows a surreal game of hide-and-seek that saw him clamber on a roof to avoid law enforcement , before being broken out of a police van by protesters amid clashes with hundreds of riot police on Tuesday . Ally and fellow Georgian , Davit Sakvarelidze , who was fired in March from his post as a senior prosecutor for Ukraine , called on Kiev residents to take to the streets to protest Saakashvili s recapture . Today Poroshenko broke all records and went down in history as a dictator who does this to political opponents , he told channel NewsOne near the detention centre in central Kiev . As of 2200 GMT , a few hundred protesters had gathered near the facility not far from the parliament , shouting Shame ! and Kiev , get up ! while a large number of police in riot gear stood guard . Saakashvili became a regional governor in Ukraine in 2015 at Poroshenko s invitation but they later fell out . Saakashvili denies the allegations against him . The saga threatens to embarrass the pro-Western authorities at a time when they face a chorus of criticism from reformers and foreign donors over perceived backtracking on reforms and attacks on anti-corruption institutions . On Friday , Poroshenko said the case against Saakashvili was legitimate and that he should cooperate with investigators . If he flees from the investigation , this undermines his credibility , he said . After escaping police custody , Saakashvili called for a rally against Poroshenko in Kiev to be held on Sunday , although he has kept a low profile in recent days after reportedly catching a cold while sleeping in makeshift protest camp outside parliament . The politician s latest detention followed a failed attempt by police to recapture him in a raid on the camp on Wednesday , which led to violent clashes with protesters . While Saakashvili has a core base of supporters , he enjoys limited support across Ukraine . Only 1.7 percent of voters would support his party , the Movement of New Forces , in elections , according to an October survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Centre think-tank . His backers see him as a fearless crusader against corruption but critics have said that there is little substance behind his rhetoric .',\n",

Now we re facing the prospect of Iranian allies holding our countrymen hostage.It really is amazing how many parallels Obama shares with Jimmy Carter . Here s a pretty awful one : The rebel group that has seized power in Yemen has taken at least four U.S. citizens prisoner , according to U.S. officials who said that efforts to secure the Americans release have faltered.One of the prisoners had been cleared for release in recent days only to have that decision reversed by members of the Houthi rebellion that toppled the U.S.-backed government earlier this year and now controls most levers of power in Yemen.The Americans are believed to be held at a prison in Sanaa , the Yemeni capital , which has been bombed repeatedly as part of an air campaign led by Saudi Arabia aimed at dislodging the Houthis from power . The United States has provided intelligence support to that operation.The detention of the Americans has complicated U.S. efforts to navigate the chaotic aftermath of the Houthi takeover , which displaced a government that had cooperated extensively with the United States on drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations against a dangerous al-Qaeda affiliate in the country.U.S . officials said three of the prisoners worked in private-sector jobs and that a fourth , whose occupation is unknown , has dual U.S.-Yemeni citizenship .

       " 'During an on interview on This Week , Bernie Sanders had to deal with some seriously weak interview questions . The interviewer , Martha Raddatz brought up an allegation that Sanders surging campaign has been unsettling the markets . That accusation is as ridiculous as it sounds.Here is how the interview went.Martha Raddatz : Senator Sanders , you said something to your supporters yesterday that caught my ear , you quoted with pride a Wall Street Journal article calling you a viable candidate , saying it appears that we are making Wall Street a little bit nervous and that s a good thing . The article was quoting Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman who said the markets are unsettled because of you , a slowdown in China and geopolitical risks . You re laughing , but I want to know why is it a good thing that the markets are in turmoil ? People have their pension funds in the market ? Lots of middle class people have their 401 ( k ) s invested in stocks . It s not just Wall Street . Everybody is affected by this . Bernie Sanders : The reason that I am laughing is I fully admit to having a big ego , like many other politicians . But the idea that Bernie Sanders candidacy , because it has growing support all over this country , is unsettling world markets is absolutely absurd . The point I was making is we are getting the attention of Wall Street . Wall Street s greed and recklessness and illegal behavior drove this economy into the worst recession since the Clutch Plague . Millions of people lost their homes , their life savings and their jobs . And yes I believe that we have to break up the major financial institutions . We have to reestablish Glass-Steagall . And that we are now gaining the attention of Wall Street tells me that our campaign is doing very well . Here s the interview : For those not in the know , the Blackstone Group is one of the largest and most powerful private entities on the planet . They currently manage over $ 300 billion dollars in assists . Stephen Schwarzman currently has a net worth of $ 9.8 billion dollars . If anyone has been a beneficiary of the deregulation of Wall St. , it s Schwarzman . It isn t surprising that he , the WSJ , ( who notoriously published a completely debunked hit piece on Sanders ) and the mainstream media would be pushing this kind of nonsense . They just want to make it sound like Sanders is coming after people s 401 ( k ) s , etc.Which couldn t be further from the truth .

       " 'University trustees , known as the Yale Corporation , voted in favor of the renaming on Friday , reversing a decision last year to keep the name . Keeping the name had been defended as a way to confront rather than paper over the legacy of slavery.The change will go into effect in time for the 2017-2018 academic year . John C. Calhoun s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a positive good fundamentally conflicts with Yale s mission and values , President Peter Salovey said in a message sent to the Yale community on Saturday . He said depictions in the college celebrating plantations and the Old South suggest that Calhoun was honored in part because of his support for slavery , not in spite of it.Yale is among a number of colleges that have grappled with how to honor their histories without offending modern sensibilities . Vanderbilt University last year said it would pay $ 1.2 million to remove the word Confederate from a residence hall s facade , while Princeton University said it would keep Woodrow Wilson s name on its school of public and international affairs and a residential college , while increasing discussion of the former president s support of segregation . WSJIf Yale is so concerned about promoting diversity and working to erase any signs of slavery , why not rename the Calhoun College with their most famous black alumni , US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas ? The tradition at Yale has been to name colleges after prominent , deceased , alumni , and ones that have contributed somehow to the human race . Morse College , for instance , is named after Samuel Morse , of the eponymous Morse Code.Yale will feel immense pressure to rename Calhoun for a minority figure , but who ? Of Yale s deceased minority alumni , no one leaps to mind . Someone suggested Levi Jackson , which I thought was a nice idea , but Jackson isn t well known outside Yale circles , and I doubt any of today s students have any idea who he is.It seems likely Yale might jettison the being dead requirement . If that turns out to be the case , how about Clarence Thomas ? He is easily Yale s most prominent black alum , even if he wasn t an undergrad.I am joking of course . While I would be proud if this came about , the left would sooner burn Calhoun to the ground than let it be named for a black conservative , only going to show that this isn t about race , it s about power and politics.One other thought : Elihu Yale was apparently a slave trader , among other things . How soon before the activists set there sights on renaming the entire university ? The Naked Dollar',\n",

Legal Insurrection reports- The White House has unveiled President Donald Trump s national security strategy . It has four main points : Protect America , promote our prosperity , preserve peace through strength , and advance our influence.But one of the biggest points is the return of using jihadist and Sharia , language President Barack Obama s administration tried to avoid.From Fox News : The primary transnational threats Americans face are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations , the document states , according to excerpts released ahead of the speech.A search of the document shows the word jihadist appears 24 times in the 68 page document . Obama s 2015 national security strategy mentioned Islam twice.The document mentions that America will pursue threats to their source , so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders .

Back in January 2016 , Homeland Security released a report that called for officials to stop using jihad and sharia . The Washington Free Beacon reported at the time : Under the section on terminology , the report calls for rejecting use of an us versus them mentality by shunning Islamic language in Countering Violent Extremism programs , or CVE , the Obama administration s euphemism that seeks to avoid references to Islam.Under a section on recommended actions on terminology , the report says DHS should reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English . Government agencies should employ American English instead of religious , legal and cultural terms like jihad , sharia , takfir or umma , states the June 2016 report by the Council s countering violent extremism subcommittee . The DHS report stated that to avoid a confrontational us versus them stance in public efforts to counter Islamic radicalization , government programs should use the term American Muslim instead of Muslim American . The Obama administration insisted on this even though ISIS made it NO secret that they wanted the world to live under Sharia law . The terrorist group even formed an all female brigade to help enforce Sharia law through brutal and violent means .',\n",

This incident is deeply disturbing and is hurtful to our University community , White said in the statement . Regardless of the intent , the display has no place on our campus . I am saddened , and I am sorry for the hurt and offense this has caused and want our students , faculty , and staff to know that it will not be tolerated . As of this writing , no one has come forward to claim responsibility or , more importantly , explain what the hell they were thinking at the time . Considering that Tennessee has over 200 confirmed cases of post-Reconstruction lynchings , hanging any noose of any kind is , to be delicate , in extremely poor taste.But , even more bizarrely , it might not have been intended as hate speech : According to a student in the class who asked to not be identified , the display was a part of a project in an introductory sculpture class . The student said the project concepts and locations were approved in advance by the instructor.Comments on Instagram indicate the rainbowed noose theme has to do with the number of suicides in the LGBT community , which I can sort of see if I squint really hard . Admittedly , we ve all said or done something that sounded great in our head but turned out to be a really stupid idea in practice . I m leaning towards the suicide explanation because , frankly , I m having a hard time believing that an art instructor heard the pitch I want to hang rainbow colored nooses because I don t like gays and black people and thought it would make a lovely art project.On the other hand , even if there was no ill intent , the student that convinced an instructor to put their job at risk in this fashion can apparently sell ice to an Eskimo .

       " 'YAOUNDE - The government of one of Cameroon s Anglophone regions ordered its border with Nigeria closed this weekend in response to calls by activists for protests to demand more rights for the country s English-speaking minority . The move on Thursday represents an escalation in a crackdown on months of protest spurred by complaints about political and economic discrimination in the Anglophone regions of the predominantly Francophone country . Security forces killed six protesters and arrested hundreds of others following calls for reforms by lawyers and teachers last year , and the internet was shut down in Anglophone regions from January to April . The Anglophone regions have strong ties to eastern Nigeria , and authorities may fear that allowing the border to remain open during protests offers the demonstrators a rear base and makes it harder to maintain order . Anglophone activists have called for renewed protest on Sunday after thousands took to the streets last week , with some hoisting separatist flags . In a statement , Southwest region s governor , Bernard Okalia Bilai , said the border would be closed from 9 p.m. ( 2000 GMT ) Friday until 7 a.m. Monday following persistent threats of destabilization through manipulation by individuals acting from outside the national territory . The order also banned inter-city transportation , gatherings of more than four people in public locations and all port activity during that same period . It was not clear whether similar restrictions would be imposed in Northwest , Cameroon s other Anglophone region . The unrest has presented a fresh challenge to the government of President Paul Biya , which has faced international criticism for its response to the demonstrations . In a statement on Thursday , a U.N. spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply concerned about tensions ahead of Sunday s demonstrations and urged the government to address the grievances of English speakers . The Secretary-General supports upholding the unity and territorial integrity of Cameroon and urges all parties to refrain from acts that could lead to an escalation of tension and violence , the statement said . The country s linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One , when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors . After independence in 1960 , the English-speaking part opted to join French Cameroon instead of Nigeria .',\n",

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today ( RT ) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network , after criticism the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling . RT and Sputnik condemned the decision , saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics , while Russia ’ s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate . San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “ not something we want ” on the social network . It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik . “ We did not come to this decision lightly , and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter , ” the company said . Twitter , Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc ’ s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive . Russia has denied interfering in the election . Twitter said it would take the estimated $ 1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “ to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections. ” The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular , non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules . RT , an English-language news channel , accused Twitter ’ s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election . “ The more money RT spent , the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide , ” RT said , describing the Twitter sales pitch . It said it never “ pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms , including Twitter. ” Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers . A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter , which has struggled to turn a profit . On Thursday , Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies , which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue . Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending . In April , reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters ’ faith in the American electoral system , according to three current and four former U.S. officials . On Oct. 19 , U.S. lawmakers , alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year ’ s election , introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television , radio and satellite to also cover social media . General counsels for Twitter , Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election . “ Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised , ” Adam Sharp , a former Twitter executive , told on Thursday . The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a “ gross violation ” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech . “ Retaliatory measures , naturally , will follow , ” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said , according to the RIA news agency . Sputnik , a news agency , said on its website that Twitter ’ s move was regrettable , “ especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media. ” Some analysts said transparency , rather than a ban , would have been a better approach . Unlike Facebook , Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts , or bots , making the service more difficult to police . “ Banning any particular person , group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world , platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech , ” Albert Gidari , who as a lawyer has represented tech companies , said in an email .

       " 'Right-wing radio s high priestess of hate , Laura Ingraham , has a few questions about military spending . Namely , she wants to know if taxpayers are still footing the bill for transgender people to go and cut their private parts to death . On the Friday episode of Ingraham s radio show , she went on an offensive rant about how the U.S. military deals with medical care for those who may be transgender , and she wants some answers . What do you think about all that social experimentation they re doing in the military ? They still going to pay for those for sex change surgeries in the military with taxpayer dollars ? Aren t they are they paying for those now , Drew ? The operations for the people to go and cut their private parts to death and whatever they do ? Wasn t that a push , they want the taxpayer dollars to pay for those sex change surgeries ? What do you think old Mad Dog [ Gen. James Mattis ] is going to think about that ? We ve got to cut , but not that way . Ingraham is known for her bigotry , particularly her racist attacks on President Obama . She also gave a nod to white supremacists when she gave a Nazi salute after her speech at the Republican National Convention . Not surprisingly , this has earned her the respect of Donald Trump , who is now considering Ingraham as a contender for White House Press Secretary.As our friends at Winning Democrats pointed out when it was announced that Trump was considering her to be his mouthpiece , Ingraham is also known for her anti-women stances : Ingraham not only opposes a woman s right to choose , she attacked Anita Hill and worked to smear her for accusing Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her . Ingraham also called for defunding the Violence Against Women Act which helps fight domestic violence .

       " 'A new report from the New York Times finds that Donald Trump owes twice as much debt as he reported on his public election filings.The NY Times reports : Beyond finding that companies owned by Mr. Trump had debts of at least $ 650 million , The Times Discovered that a substantial portion of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $ 2 billion to a string of lenders , including those that hold the loan on the Avenue of the Americas building . If those loans were to go into default , Mr. trump might not be held personally liable , but the value of his investments would sink . The NY Times points out that Trump probably didn t lie about the amount of debt he has in his public filings , it s just a matter of the forms that were filled out not being designed for a person who has as complex financial holdings as Trump does.What s really interesting about the report , is that it also shows Trump s one of the very few criticisms of Hillary Clinton shared by some on the left ( which he stole from progressives anyway ) is now rendered completely invalid for him to make , due to it being completely hypocritical.The NY Times reports : An office building on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan , of which Mr. Trump is part owner , carries a $ 950 million loan . Among the lenders : the Bank of China , one of the largest banks in a country that Mr. Trump has railed against as an economic foe of the United States , and Goldman Sachs , a financial institution he has said controls Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , after it paid her $ 675,000 in speaking fees . Trump has positioned himself as a strong businessman throughout his presidential campaign . However , he has come under fire from Democrats as report after report comes out showing that he is actually a huge failure in the world of business . Most notably from Elizabeth Warren who has said that Donald Trump is a loser . Count all his failed businesses . See how he kept his father s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy ( excuse me , bankruptcies ) to skip out on debt . The report is damning and should give Democrats a few more talking points that show just how dangerous a Trump presidency would be for the United States.Featured image from Spencer Platt/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'CAIRO - Sarah Hegazy has been jailed , beaten by inmates , and could face a life sentence in an Egyptian prison if found guilty of promoting sexual deviancy and other charges tied to her alleged crime : waving a rainbow flag at a concert . The 28-year-old denies waving the flag but is one of 57 people arrested so far in Egypt s widest anti-gay crackdown yet , a swift zero-tolerance response to a rare show of public support for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) rights in the conservative Muslim country . The crackdown comes as Egypt , a key Western ally in the Middle East , is under fire for its human rights record and the United States has withheld some of its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid . Hegazy , the only woman rounded up in the three-week-old campaign , says police goaded her cellmates to abuse her during her first night in prison , where she is being detained for 15 days and interrogated by special prosecutors who usually focus on Islamist militants . This is the game they ( police ) always play , especially since she is a girl . They incite the other detainees and say this girl wants men and women to be gay so they harass her . I saw scratches on her shoulder , she looked very disheveled and exhausted . She was beaten , said Hegazy s lawyer Hoda Nasralla . A security official would not comment on Hegazy s case but denied that police incite prisoners against each other or otherwise mistreat them . Lawyers for other detainees said their clients faced similar treatment . Suspected gay male detainees are subject to forced anal exams to determine if they have had homosexual sex , a procedure human rights groups say amounts to torture . At least five such examinations have taken place , Amnesty International says . Judicial sources do not deny the examinations take place but say they are legally carried out and are not a form of abuse . Egyptian authorities do not deny going after gays and an investigation report provided to by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EIPR ) openly refers to the police s campaign on homosexuals . Police , state-aligned media , and the religious establishment all see it as a public duty to combat the spread of homosexuality . Ten men have already gone on trial during the recent sweep and received jail sentences from one to six years . On Sept. 22 , at a concert packed with 30,000 people headlined by Mashrou Leila , a Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay , a small group of concert goers raised a rainbow flag and , within hours , the image went viral . Almost immediately local media , dominated by state-aligned television personalities , began a campaign against homosexuals , saying they were receiving foreign funding , and hosting callers who compared their threat to Islamic State . Egypt s media regulator then banned homosexuals from appearing in the media unless they were repenting , calling homosexuality a shame and a disease that should be kept under wraps , not promoted in order to protect public morality . Al-Azhar , Egypt s 1,000-year-old center of Islamic learning , said it would stand against gays in the way it stands against Islamist extremists . One church organized an anti-gay conference . Public Prosecutor Nabil Sadek ordered the State Security Prosecution , which normally investigates terrorism and other national security threats , to investigate the flag incident . At least four people , including Hegazy and 21-year-old Ahmed Alaa , were arrested for allegedly raising the flag although one man has since been released . The overwhelming majority of those arrested are not involved in the flag case , however , and have simply been arrested over their perceived sexual orientation in the following days . Police have raided homes , parties , and used online dating apps to lure gay men - a common tactic in Egypt - to arrest most of them , their lawyers say . At a Cairo courthouse defendants stood in a cage , holding up newspapers and books to hide their faces to shield themselves from the stigma of homosexuality in Egyptian society . Although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt , it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife . Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery , immorality or blasphemy . The last comparable crackdown on homosexuals in Egypt was in 2001 , when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat . Fifty-two men were tried in the case , which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and Western governments . But the current wave has already surpassed that incident both in numbers and in state action , with defendants facing much faster trials than usual , said Dalia Abd Elhameed , EIPR s gender and women s rights officer . No Western government has publicly condemned or commented on this crackdown , but Egypt is facing criticism from the United States , a major ally , over its human rights record . Washington denied Egypt $ 95.7 million in aid and delayed a further $ 195 million because it failed to make progress on human rights and democracy , U.S. sources told in August . Egypt has taken a leading role at the United Nations in opposing gay rights . It was one of 13 countries to vote last week against a U.N. resolution condemning the death penalty for having gay sex . It led a dozen states in boycotting a session in January with the first U.N. expert on anti-gay violence and discrimination . It sent a letter last year on behalf of Muslim countries to the secretary-general that led to the exclusion of 22 gay and transgender rights groups from the U.N. General Assembly s High Level Meeting on Ending Aids . Gay men and rights activists say the LGBT community has been facing an aggressive crackdown since 2013 , when President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as military chief ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Mursi . EIPR has documented 232 cases between October 2013 and March 2017 where people were arrested for allegedly being gay or transgender , Abd Elhameed said . Many of these cases went to court where the average sentence was around three years in jail , although in some cases it went up to 12 . Sisi has been criticized by the Brotherhood as being anti-Islam , and rights groups say tough treatment of the LGBT community is a way to counter that while diverting attention from the country s tough economic conditions . The crackdown has Egypt s already underground LGBT community living in fear . Five gay men who all requested anonymity said they were avoiding gay-friendly spaces and deleting online dating profiles for fear of arrest . Some are considering leaving the country . But the recent developments underscore an existing reality for gay Egyptians : they are in constant physical danger . I don t feel comfortable just being myself . We re not talking about gay rights here , no one is calling for marriage equality , we face the possibility of jail and humiliation for merely existing , said one 25-year-old gay man . A 31-year-old gay man recounted how he was tied up and beaten at his Cairo flat last year by two men who threatened to kill him after meeting through the gay dating app Grindr . They posed as police officers at some point , playing on a common fear for gay Egyptians , before stealing items from his flat . The man says he later felt going to the police was almost as traumatic as the incident itself . Police records show officers create false dating profiles and set up dates only to arrest the men who show up . Sometimes they tell the men to bring condoms then use them as evidence , Abd Elhameed said . There are people in the Interior Ministry who take our money as taxpayers to engage in sex chatting with people then arrest them . It is as ridiculous as this ; the evidence sheets include nude photos and erotic chat transcripts .',\n",

       " 'PARIS - The right-hand man of French National Front chief Marine Le Pen quit the party on Thursday , a split that opens the way for policy changes in the far-right party and shows the depth of internal feuding after Le Pen s presidential election defeat . The departure of Florian Philippot , for years Le Pen s closest aide and a key architect of efforts to detoxify the party s image while campaigning against the euro , had looked increasingly inevitable as the party bickered over who was to blame for a damaging electoral cycle . His exit is expected to allow Le Pen to refocus on core policies around immigration and French national identity , while perhaps softening her anti-euro tone , which many say contributed to Le Pen s resounding defeat in the presidential election run-off . While Philippot s departure is likely to increase turmoil in the party at first and others have already said they would follow him out the door , the FN has survived similar crises in the past and analysts expect it to do the same this time . Philippot is seen as too divisive within the far-right to create a party that would be a serious threat . Le Pen , who has shown a sometimes ruthless determination to hold on to power in the National Front , having already pushed out her father Jean-Marie , the founder of the party , withdrew Philippot s responsibilities within the movement late on Wednesday , leaving him with little choice about his future . I m not into being ridiculed , I m not into having nothing to do . And so yes , of course , I m quitting the National Front , Philippot , 35 and a graduate of France s elite administrative school ENA , told France 2 television . Le Pen , who just last year spoke of having an intellectual crush on Philippot , responded tersely that the FN would have no problems of getting over his departure . One should stop trying to bury the National Front , she told LCP television . Every time people have tried to do it , it came out better-structured , stronger and more powerful . The National Front , which has made major inroads in local , regional and European elections over the past decade without winning any major constituency , will hold a congress in March where internal differences since its defeat to Emmanuel Macron and his new party will come to a head . The far-right party has tried to portray itself as the main voice of opposition against Macron . But that mantle has so far been assumed by Jean-Luc Melenchon , the leader of the far-left France Insoumise ( France Unbowed ) , who is calling for mass demonstrations against the president s economic reforms . FAR-LEFT THRILLED Appearing on France s RTL Radio on Thursday , Melenchon reveled in the turmoil on the far-right . Excellent , that s their business . It s perfect , he said in reaction to Philippot s departure . It s a party that counts for nothing . Those that were angry but aren t fascists , I urge them to turn their back ( on the FN ) and come and join us . J r me Fourquet , an expert on the far-right at polling group Ifop , said Philippot s exit would deprive the party of experienced policy writers . But he said any exodus was likely to be limited and short of those who quit when Bruno Megret left the party in 1988 , when it was led by Jean-Marie Le Pen . Megret created his own party but it never attracted many votes . Those who leave the FN or are pushed out all end up being marginalized , Fourquet said . Philippot joined the party in 2011 and rose quickly to become Le Pen s chief adviser . He was instrumental in crafting her policies and her 2012 and 2017 election manifestos . Sophie Montel , one of Philippot s closest aides and an FN member for over 30 years , said on Twitter she was quitting the party . So did several other Philippot allies . But other more high profile figures rejoiced , including Le Pen s partner Louis Aliot . The FN will finally have some peace of mind away from a sectarian , arrogant , vain extremist who was trying to muzzle our freedom to debate , Aliot said on Twitter . He thinks he s right about everything and ... for me he s an extremist , he said later , speaking to RMC . When you show him a poll that says 75 percent of the French people don t want to leave the euro , his reply is we don t give a damn , that s where we are going . Robert Menard , an FN ally and a mayor in southern France , was even blunter , saying : We need to stop with the anti-Europeanism and the Melenchon-type ( economic ) policies . Le Pen said the party would continue to fight the EU and wanted a return to monetary sovereignty . But after many flip-flops on the issue , she did not spell out precisely what that would entail .',\n",

       " 'Earlier in the week , there were leaked draft executive orders circulating that would strike President Obama s executive order protections for LGBTQ federal workers . There were also rumors that Donald Trump would sign a sweeping , broadly worded religious freedom bill into law that would effectively legalize discrimination nationwide . However , Trump and his famously homophobic vice president , Mike Pence , ran into a road block : Trump s kids . Specifically , his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump.Jared and Ivanka have long been seen to be the reasonable , moderating influences that are needed to calm Trump s impulsive , erratic temperament . It appears that this is what happened here . Ivanka and Jared see all of the fear and the protests in the streets against Trump , and they feared that there would be even more national and international backlash against Trump s bigotry via executive order . Therefore , there was a complete reversal on these orders.Of course , White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outright lied when asked about it . He insisted that these orders were just a couple out of hundreds that were being considered . Then , of course , a statement was hastily rushed out , saying that the Trump administration is determined to protect the rights of all Americans , including the LGBTQ community . Considering all of the virulently anti-LGBTQ people Trump has around him namely Mike Pence I don t believe that for so much as a second . If Ivanka and Jared can keep Trump s hands away from the LGBTQ community for the time being , though , all the better . Hopefully it will hold until 2018 , and we manage to take Congress back , thus crippling the amount of damage Trump and Pence can do until they are out of office.While their reasons were political rather than noble , at this point , it s better than nothing.Featured image via Aaron P.

       " 'At the beginning of the year , a new law went into effect in Texas authorizing responsible gun owners to carry their weapons around pretty much anywhere as long as they have gone through the incredibly easy process of obtaining a concealed carry permit . As the NRA tells us constantly these individuals , these good guys with guns , are ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger to protect the innocent from bad guys with guns . Unfortunately , the problem is that the good guys often can become bad guys the moment they get a little bit angry something we saw unfold on Friday and Saturday in Uvalde , Texas . Four people are dead after a 19-hour standoff with police at a trailer park . It s a mess in there right now , a Uvalde County Sheriff s Office deputy told News 4 San Antonio.Details are scarce , but police have announced that no officers were hurt in the battle with an unannounced number of gunmen and/or women . Uvalde County Sheriff s had responded to reports of shots fired at the trailer park . After police arrived , the suspects opened fire on responding officers none of whom were hurt , fortunately . People in the trailer park and in neighboring homes were not permitted into the area while the blood battle between good guys with guns and police.Unfortunately , the mass proliferation of guns in the United States creates a situation where no one is ever truly safe not in their homes , not in church , not walking down the street , or anywhere else . The lie that a good guy with a gun will save the day is a gross misrepresentation of reality . In fact , they re just as likely to score a headshot on the person they are saving as to actually save someone.While many argue that it s their right to carry their self-confidence on their hips , the fact is that keeping a gun around actually makes you less safe than having no gun at all and then , of course , there s the chance that any responsible gun owner could snap at any time and start shooting . While it s true that we don t know what sparked this shootout , we can safely assume that the people who turned their guns on police surely thought of themselves as the good guys .

       " 'Donald Trump s Twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy . Unfortunately , since the orange overlord is now squatting in the Oval Office , those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives , and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world . Case in point the fact that he insisted upon attacking Democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling , the Children s Health Insurance Program , the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , and other important domestic policy initiatives . Apparently , Trump saw fit to take to Twitter to accuse his old pals Chuck and Nancy of not being strong enough on crime and immigration , and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them : Meeting with Chuck and Nancy today about keeping government open and working . Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked , are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes . I don t see a deal ! Donald J.

Leader Pelosi then took to Twitter herself to take Trump on : Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House , we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead .

       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said Congress must end its deadlock on funding to combat the Zika virus before lawmakers head out to recess later this summer . “ The good news is we feel fairly confident that we can develop an effective vaccine for Zika , ” Obama said after a meeting with U.S. health officials in the Oval Office . “ The problem is right now that money is stuck in Congress. ” Obama met with the heads of the Health and Human Services Department , the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss the nation ’ s response to the mosquito-borne virus . Earlier this week , Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal to provide $ 1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika . Democrats and the White House said the plan fell short of Obama ’ s $ 1.9 billion funding request and included measures that would take funds from other important health initiatives . “ We have not seen the House ( of Representatives ) and Senate come together in a sensible way to put forward the dollars that we have requested to get the job done , ” Obama said . “ I expect Congress to get this funding done before they adjourn , as part of their basic responsibility. ” U.S. lawmakers typically go on recess in August to go campaign for re-election in their home districts . Following the deadlock , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused each other of playing politics with the health crisis . Zika has caused concern throughout the Americas due to an alarming rise in cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to the virus reported in Brazil , the country hardest hit by the outbreak . Infants with microcephaly tend to have abnormally small heads and may experience potentially disabling developmental problems . While Obama said there have not been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the continental United States , he said the nation is home to mosquitoes that carry the virus . “ It is absolutely critical for the United States government , working in concert with other governments in the hemisphere , to be pushing hard right now to get this situation under control , ” Obama said . As of June 23 , there have been seven babies born in the United States with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects such as serious brain abnormalities , and five lost pregnancies from either miscarriage , stillbirth or termination .',\n",
       " 'The H1-B Visa program is being used and abused by American companies like Disney and Abbott Labs in Illinois . Disney was in the spotlight recently for an ex-employee s tearful testimony before Congress about being replaced by a foreign worker only after being forced to train the new employee . Talk about adding insult to injury ! More and more displaced employees are speaking out and shining a light on the practice of bringing in foreign workers at cheaper prices in place of Americans . The argument many corporations make is that there s a shortage of people in the particular field they re hiring foreign workers for . This is a fallacy and is NOT TRUE ! LIBERTYVILLE , Ill. American corporations are under new scrutiny from federal lawmakers after well-publicized episodes in which the companies laid off American workers and gave the jobs to foreigners on temporary visas.But while corporate executives have been outspoken in defending their labor practices before Congress and the public , the American workers who lost jobs to global outsourcing companies have been largely silent.Until recently . Now some of the workers who were displaced are starting to speak out , despite severance agreements prohibiting them from criticizing their former employers.Marco Pe a was among about 150 technology workers who were laid off in April by Abbott Laboratories , a global health care conglomerate with headquarters here . They handed in their badges and computer passwords , and turned over their work to a company based in India . But Mr. Pe a , who had worked at Abbott for 12 years , said he had decided not to sign the agreement that was given to all departing employees , which included a nondisparagement clause.Mr . Pe a said his choice cost him at least $ 10,000 in severance pay . But on an April evening after he walked out of Abbott s tree-lined campus here for the last time , he spent a few hours in a local bar at a gathering organized by technology worker advocates , speaking his mind about a job he had loved and lost . I just didn t feel right about signing , Mr. Pe a said . The clauses were pretty blanket . I felt like they were eroding my rights . Leading members of Congress from both major parties have questioned the nondisparagement agreements , which are commonly used by corporations but can prohibit ousted workers from raising complaints about what they see as a misuse of temporary visas . Lawmakers , including Richard Durbin of Illinois , the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat , and Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration , have proposed revisions to visa laws to include measures allowing former employees to contest their layoffs . I have heard from workers who are fearful of retaliation , said Senator Richard Blumenthal , Democrat of Connecticut . They are told they can say whatever they want , except they can t say anything negative about being fired . Lawyers said the paragraph Mr. Pe a and other workers object to in their separation agreements is routine in final contracts with employees who are paid severance as they leave , whether they were laid off or resigned voluntarily . It s a very , very common practice , said Sheena R. Hamilton , an employment lawyer at Dowd Bennett in St. Louis who represents companies in workplace cases . I ve never recommended a settlement that didn t have a clause like that . Read more : NYT',\n",
       " 'BLOEMFONTEIN , South Africa - South Africa s Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate nearly 800 corruption charges filed against Jacob Zuma before he became president . Zuma , who has faced and denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office , said he was disappointed by the court s decision and asked the National Prosecuting Authority ( NPA ) to consider representations before deciding whether to proceed against him . It was unclear when the NPA would make a decision on the charges , which relate to a 30 billion rand ( $ 2 billion ) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s . The ruling is likely to amplify calls for Zuma , 75 , to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 and diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) chooses a new leader in December . It is going to make it a lot more difficult for his camp to get their presidential candidate elected , said Gary van Staden , political analyst with NKC African Economics . Friday s unanimous Supreme Court ruling upheld a High Court decision in April 2016 that the charges against Zuma should be reinstated . They had been set aside in April 2009 by the then-head of the prosecuting authority , paving the way for Zuma to run for president later that year . Rejecting an appeal brought by Zuma and the NPA , Judge Lorimer Leach said it was irrational for the NPA to have set the charges aside the same word used by the High Court . It is difficult to understand why the present regime at the NPA considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended , the Supreme Court s Leach said . NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said prosecutors would need to consider the judgment but would at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice . In a separate statement , the NPA said Zuma s lawyers had asked the state prosecutor not to serve an indictment on his client nor to re-enrol the matter prior to the representations having been considered . The prospect that Zuma s removal may be inching closer lifted the rand against the dollar . Zuma is unpopular with many investors after sacking respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March , a move that hit South African financial assets and helped tip the country s credit ratings into junk territory . Zuma has faced persistent corruption allegations , most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the Gupta family may have used their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies . has not independently verified the emails , and Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrongdoing . Mmusi Maimane , leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance , said he would write to the National Director of Public Prosecutions , Shaun Abrahams , to demand he indict Zuma . The charges have been formulated and the evidence is ready . We now await a trial date , Maimane told reporters . Asked by reporters whether Zuma should resign , the African National Congress ( ANC ) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said the party would allow that process to take its course . The first thing is whether the NPA will decide to charge the president , he said . You re putting the cart before the horse . National prosecutor Mokotedi Mpshe s decision in 2009 to drop the 783 charges against Zuma in what has become known as the Spy Tapes case was based on phone intercepts presented by Zuma s legal team . They suggested the timing of the charges in late 2007 may have been part of a political plot to stop Zuma , then deputy president , running for the top job . Zuma was linked to the 1990s arms deal through his former financial adviser , who was jailed for corruption . Analysts said the credibility of Zuma and the NPA were in question after the ruling . One lawyer , Ulrich Roux , who speaks to media as a legal analyst , said a private prosecution could be instituted if charges are not brought .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday took aim at Democrats and Republicans alike in his final appearance headlining the star-studded White House correspondents ’ dinner , but saved his sharpest barbs for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump . “ The Republican establishment is incredulous that he ’ s their most likely nominee , ” Obama told attendees at the black-tie event , which brought together journalists and media moguls with Hollywood stars and power brokers from Capitol Hill and beyond . “ They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president . But in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world : Miss Sweden , Miss Argentina , Miss Azerbaijan , ” the president said to howls of laughter , referring to contestants on the Miss Universe pageant that Trump formerly co-owned . Obama made fun of the angst many in the Republican establishment have expressed at the prospect that Trump or Tea Party candidate Ted Cruz could win the party ’ s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election . “ Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish , but instead a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan , ” Obama said , referring to the top Republican in the House of Representatives , who many have hoped could be lured into running for president . “ That ’ s not an option people , ” Obama said , displaying comedic chops perfected through seven previous appearances at the annual dinner . “ You may not like steak or fish , but that ’ s your choice. ” In his remarks , Obama looked back on his presidency and jokingly predicted the country may be nearing its doom . “ The end of the republic has never looked better , ” the tuxedo-clad president said looking out at the well-groomed crowd as he blasted Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus . “ Congratulations on all your success , ” Obama told Priebus , while wearing a sarcastic grin . “ The Republican party , the nomination process – it ’ s all going great. ” Larry Wilmore , the host of a show on cable outlet Comedy Central , took his own shots at Trump when he took the podium after Obama , joking that next year the dinner will be called : “ Donald Trump presents a luxurious evening paid for by Mexico. ” Trump has famously promised to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to prevent illegal immigration , and he has said he would force Mexico to pay for it . With a bit of nostalgia , Obama reflected on his more than seven years in office , saying he had been a young man of idealism and vigor before he became president . “ Eight years ago I said it was time to change the tone of our politics , ” Obama said . “ In hindsight , I clearly should have been more specific . ”',\n",

The American people are tired of Washington playing by different rules . In order to escape the skyrocketing premiums and other disadvantages of Obamacare , Congress defined itself as a small business which would entail an organization that employs fifty people or less .

For starters , it keeps many of the items that infuriate conservatives intact , while at the same time doing everything that Obamacare did , but less well . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that over 24 million people would likely lose their health insurance thanks to this bill . For many people , it would also cause their premiums to skyrocket.Rather than fix the bill or better yet , keep the ACA Trump and Ryan are making huge concessions to the ultra-right . One such concession is to remove the health care part of the health care bill . Republicans are considering dropping the so-called essential health benefits of the ACA , allowing insurers to pick and chose what they want to cover . Naturally , things like maternity care and emergency services would be the first to go . Which brings us back to the House Freedom Caucus and its all-male members.In a dimly lit room , the group of conservative white men sat around a table and weighed the relative merits of providing maternity care to women .

Austerity policies have not worked , on monetary policy we deserve the credit for triggering a debate ... this is why we raised the issue of a referendum on the euro , as a bargaining tool , as a last resort and a way out in case Mediterranean countries are not listened to , he said . Two years ago the party gathered the signatures from the public needed to pave the way for a referendum that it said was vital to restore Italy s fiscal and monetary sovereignty . But now , running neck-and-neck with the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) in opinion polls and with the election in sight - scheduled to be held by May 2018 - it is hitting the brakes on the idea . This underlines the crucial challenge facing the party as it seeks to please some core supporters , while trying to shed its populist image and convince foreign capitals and financial markets that it can be trusted in office . had access to the comments , which were made behind closed doors . Highlighting the sensitivity of the issue , Di Maio declined to answer journalists questions about the referendum before making his speech inside the Ambrosetti conference in Cernobbio , on the shores of Lake Como , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) from Milan . The party wants several changes to the euro zone s economic rules to help its more sluggish economies , like Italy . These include stripping public investment from budget deficits under the EU s Stability Pact and creating a European bad bank to deal with euro zone lenders bad loans . We are not against the European Union , we want to remain in the EU and discuss some of the rules that are suffocating and damaging our economy , said Di Maio , who serves as deputy speaker of the Chamber of Deputies . An opinion poll in La Stampa daily on Sunday had 24 percent of respondents saying Di Maio most deserved to run the country in the next five years , against 17 percent for former PD Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and 12 percent for center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi . Di Maio s presence at the Ambrosetti meeting , an annual gathering of Italy s elite business leaders , prompted some 5-Star supporters , including a respected magistrate they had recommended as the next head of state , to accuse the movement of schmoozing with the enemy . Last year , he turned down an invitation from organizers at the last minute . But with 5-Star expected to announce its candidate for prime minister later this month , he has been rubbing shoulders with the Italian establishment at a string of events . A couple of days ago he graced the red carpet at the Venice film festival , and later on Sunday he will attend the Italian Grand Prix Formula One race in Monza . Five-Star , as a force that is putting itself forward to run the country , must talk to everybody , explaining its own vision for the government and the country . This is why I accepted the invitation , he told reporters in Cernobbio .',\n",
       " 'HARRISBURG , Pa. - Green Party candidate Jill Stein late Saturday vowed to bring her fight for a recount of votes cast in Pennsylvania in the U.S. presidential election to federal court , after a state judge ordered her campaign to post a $ 1 million bond . “ The Stein campaign will continue to fight for a statewide recount in Pennsylvania , ” Jonathan Abady , lead counsel to Stein ’ s recount efforts , said in a statement . Saying it has become clear that “ the state court system is so ill-equipped to address this problem , ” the statement said “ we must seek federal court intervention. ” The Stein campaign said it will file for emergency relief in the Pennsylvania effort in federal court on Monday , “ demanding a statewide recount on constitutional grounds. ” The bond was set by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania a day after representatives of President-elect Donald Trump requested a $ 10 million bond , according to court papers . The court gave the petitioners until 5 p.m. local time ( 2200 GMT ) on Monday to post the bond , but said it could modify the amount if shown good cause . Instead , Stein ’ s campaign withdrew . “ Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means . They can not afford to post the $ 1,000,000 bond required by the court , ” wrote attorney Lawrence Otter , informing the court of the decision to withdraw . Stein , who garnered about 1 percent of the presidential vote on Nov. 8 , has also sought recounts in Michigan and Wisconsin . Trump won narrow victories over Democrat Hillary Clinton in all three states , part of the industrial heartland of the country until manufacturers started leaving for Mexico and other low-wage countries . Trump and his allies have attempted to stop the initiatives in the states , calling the recount effort a “ scam. ” Clinton ’ s campaign has said it would take part in the recounts . “ The judge ’ s outrageous demand that voters pay such an exorbitant figure is a shameful , unacceptable barrier to democratic participation , ” Stein said in a statement . “ No voter in America should be forced to pay thousands of dollars to know if her or his vote was counted. ” Stein said she planned to announce “ the next step ” in the recount effort on Monday at a previously scheduled news conference at Trump Tower in New York City . She said recounts already under way in some Pennsylvania counties would continue . The state ’ s election commission had approved recounts in 75 precincts where voters requested one , but refused to allow a full forensic audit of voting machines . Even if all the recounts were to take place , the overall election outcome would not likely change . The race is decided by the Electoral College , or a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests , rather than by the popular national vote . Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win , with 306 . Recounts would have to flip the result to Clinton in all three states to change the result . In the popular vote , Clinton had more than 2.5 million votes over Trump , the independent Cook Political Report said .',\n",

       " 'Insane ! This really is the definition of insanity . Letting non-citizens vote in our elections is something no other country would even consider ever ! When you elect a socialist radical as mayor then I guess that s what you get New York City lawmakers and Mayor Bill de Blasio are reportedly discussing legislation that would give voting rights to non-citizens in local elections . The Guardian noted that under the legislation that is being discussed , legally documented residents who have lived in New York City for at least six months will be able to vote in municipal elections . Lawmakers are reportedly discussing the legislation with Mayor Bill de Blasio s office and a bill might be introduced as soon as this spring . Two years ago , city councilman Daniel Dromm won the support of 35 of the city council s 51 members , forming a veto-proof majority when he tried to advance the non-citizen voting bill , but he faced the obstruction of then council speaker Christine Quinn and the unbreakable opposition of the Bloomberg administration . De Blasio has said he is willing to continue the conversation on non-citizen voting . Non-citizens make up as much as half the population in areas that Dromm represents and studies have found that more than a million would be eligible to vote citywide if such de Blasio were to sign such a bill . New York recently instituted its IDNYC card , which gives illegal immigrants access to a variety of city services in addition to the municipal identification card . As the Guardian points out , many Americans find the idea of non-citizen voting entirely unpalatable and fear that it undermines the sanctity and privilege of citizenship . Peter Schuck , an emeritus professor of law at Yale University , told the outlet , My guess is that it would cause many Americans to wonder what the point of citizenship is if anyone can vote without even bothering to learn or be committed enough to apply for naturalization . Eric Ulrich , one of three Republicans on the city council , recently told Newsday , The right to vote is a privilege and a sacred obligation that citizens have enjoyed . It should only be for United States citizens . It s also a reason for people who are on a path to citizenship to aspire to citizenship . It s something for them to look forward to . Six Maryland jurisdictions and Chicago allow non-citizens to vote in some local elections , and activists in Amherst , Massachusetts , Madison , Wisconsin , and Burlington , Vermont are also clamoring to give voting rights to non-citizens . -Breitbart NewsVia : Brietbart News',\n",
       " 'These are statistics are shocking and very telling . Please be sure to share this piece with Hillary voters who support a candidate that welcomes un-vetted refugees to America with open arms in the name of diversity . Obama and his regime have been shaming Americans into believing that there is something wrong with us for being suspicious of radicalized Muslims in America . Barack Hussein Obama has gone out of his way to criticize Christianity , going as far back as the Crusades to make a point about Christians committing acts of violence against Muslims . He has also gone out of his way to embrace Islam . Is it any small wonder he is endorsed and adored by one of the most radical Muslims in America , leader of the Nation of Islam , Louis Farrakhan ? On the back of the Brussels terror attack it is worthwhile remembering that while a majority of Muslims in the West appear to have no truck with terrorism or extremism , there are a significant number who sympathise with terrorism and repeatedly attempt to justify attacks on the West.TERRORISMAn ICM poll from 2006 revealed that 20 per cent of British Muslims sympathised with the 7/7 bombers who brought terror to the streets of the British capital , killing 52 and injuring hundreds . This number rose to one in four British Muslims , according to NOP Research for Channel 4 . With a British Muslim population of over 3 million today , that translates to roughly three quarters of a million terror-sympathising people in the UK.The number rises for younger British Muslims a sure sign that radicalisation through schools , mosques , and prisons ( often via Saudi-funded groups ) is creating a long-term problem in Europe . Thirty-one per cent of younger British Muslims endorsed or excused the 7/7 bombings of 2005 , with just 14 per cent of those over 45 doing so.Here are a few examples of tweets we found last night on Twitter following the Brussels terror attack : A 2013 study found that 16 per cent of young Muslims in Belgium believed that state terrorism is acceptable , while 12 per cent of young Muslims in Britain said that suicide attacks against civilians in Britain can be justified.Pew Research from 2007 found that 26 per cent of young Muslims in America believed suicide bombings are justified , with 35 per cent in Britain , 42 per cent in France , 22 per cent in Germany , and 29 per cent in Spain feeling the same way.And Muslims who are more devout or dedicated to Islam are three times more likely to believe that suicide bombings are justified a harrowing statistic when you consider that 86 per cent of Muslims in Britain feel that religion is the most important thing in their life . While just 5 per cent of UK Muslims said they would not report a terror attack being planned , the number leaps to 18 per cent amongst young , British Muslims.The anti-police narrative fueled by groups like Black Lives Matter are no doubt contributing to this idea that people should not work with the police , with the British Muslim Youth group recently urging a boycott of police.More recently , in 2015 , it was revealed that 45 per cent of British Muslims think that hate preachers that advocate violence against the West represent mainstream Islam . Forty per cent of British Muslims say they want Sharia law in the West , while 41 per cent oppose it.Despite the fact that Islamophobia did not rise after the Paris Attacks , there remains a grievance industry across the Western world which targets young Muslims especially , urging them to feel victimised by Western governments for taking a stance against Islamism and scarcely a tough stance at that.CRIMINALITYDo these stats explain Obama s rush for a mass release of prisoners before he leaves office ? Earlier this year it was reported that one in five prisoners in the United Kingdom s top security jails is now Muslim , a rise of 23 per cent from just five years ago . In total , a 20 per cent increase in the jail population in Britain has been outstripped by the rise in Muslim inmates up 122 per cent over 13 years.The same disproportionate figures are borne out across the United States , where Pew data from 2011 revealed that Muslims made up 9 per cent of state and federal prisoners though at the time Muslims made up just 0.8 per cent of the U.S. population.In 2008 , the Washington Post reported About 60 to 70 percent of all inmates in [ France s ] prison system are Muslim , according to Muslim leaders , sociologists and researchers , though Muslims make up only about 12 percent of the country s population . INTEGRATION Despite hundreds of millions of pounds , dollars , and euros spent on integration projects , it appears to be a Sisyphean task calling into question the rate at which immigration is occurring throughout the Western world and the tolerance with which our societies have operate thus far.The BBC found that 36 per cent of 16 to 24-year-old Muslims believe that if a Muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death . Thirty five per cent of Muslims say they would prefer to send their children to an Islamic school , and 37 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds say they want government-funded Islamic schools to send their kids to.The report again highlights the radicalization of the Muslim youth in the West , with 74 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds preferring Muslim women to wear the veil , compared with only 28 per cent for those over the age of 55 .

       " 'WASHINGTON - The head of the House of Representatives ’ tax-writing committee said on Sunday he would not accept elimination of a federal deduction for state and local taxes , opposing a proposal from Senate Republicans that would hike taxes for some middle class Americans . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate . Asked on “ Fox News Sunday ” if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely , Brady said : “ That ’ s what I ’ m saying. ” The deduction for state and local taxes , known as SALT , has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory . It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax , typically Democratic-leaning states such as California , New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and Massachusetts . Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances . Republicans control both the House and the Senate . Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday . Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year . The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely . The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes , but preserve it for property tax up to $ 10,000 a year . Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals . “ I know that everyone ’ s stressing the differences - there are some - but there ’ s far more common ground , ” he said . Both the House and Senate plans would add $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt , an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans . Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations . They are both widely seen as a boon for business . Congressional Democrats have criticized the Republican plans as lopsided , favoring wealthy Americans and corporate interests . “ Both the House and the Senate bills would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families , particularly in the suburbs , while providing a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy , ” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said . “ Republicans should go back to the drawing board and fully restore the SALT deduction , ” he said in a statement . Some analyses show that some Americans would see a tax increase under both plans . Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union ” on Sunday , although he said most middle-class families would be better off . “ For most people - and , again , it may not be 100 percent , but by far the majority - both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief , ” he said . White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said both plans adhere to Trump ’ s two main objectives in overhauling the tax code : a tax cut for middle-income Americans and a deep reduction in the corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses competitive . “ That ’ s how we ’ re going to grow the economy . That ’ s how we ’ re going to pay for the tax bill , ” Cohn said on Fox ’ s “ Sunday Morning Futures. ” A report by Congress ’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this month that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 per year , beginning in 2023 . Republican Representative Peter King has fiercely opposed the elimination of the SALT deduction , saying many in his home state of New York earning $ 300,000 a year were hardworking , two-income families facing a very high cost of living . “ They ’ re not hedge fund people , ” King said on “ Sunday Morning Futures. ” “ These are hardworking people and they ’ re going to get screwed by this bill . ”',\n",

       " 'AACHEN , Germany - Social Democrat Martin Schulz on Saturday read out a message he received via Facebook from a young Syrian migrant who called on Germans to exercise their right to vote in Sunday s national election . In an open letter to the German people , Abdul Abbasi , a translator at a migrant legal clinic in Goettingen , talked of watching friends killed before his eyes while participating in pro-democracy demonstrations in Syria in 2012 , Schulz said . Their goals and desires were things that are considered normal in Germany in 2017 . They died because they wanted to live as free people ... they wanted the right to participate in the politics of their country , Abbasi wrote . The ability to vote and live in a democratic country is a dream of many in this world , he said . Go vote and protect your democracy , protect us from people who divide us into categories , fight against our ability to live together and want to divide the society . Abbasi was not immediately available to comment . His Facebook profile said he was from Aleppo , Syria , and was studying dentistry at the University of Goettingen . Schulz said the letter underscored the importance of voting at a time when the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) party is poised to become the first far-right party in the Bundestag since the end of World War Two . Abbasi posted the open letter in response to a Facebook posting in which Schulz called the AfD a danger to our democracy and said it has no business being in parliament . Founded in 2013 to oppose large bailouts of financially strapped euro zone countries , the AfD has gained popular support after Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 opened the doors to about a million migrants . It is now polling around 13 percent . What a wonderful letter , and what a challenge for us , Schulz told thousands of supporters gathered for his final campaign appearance . With support of around 21 percent , the SPD is running far behind Merkel s conservatives in the polls , which are at 34 percent . Electoral arithmetic might yet force Merkel to renew her coalition with the SPD , or she might opt for a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats ( FDP ) and environmental Greens .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination , saying it was the only way to keep Republican Donald Trump out of the White House . “ I have decided to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe this is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump , ” Brown said in a letter to California Democrats and independents posted online . Brown , a popular Democrat who has steered the nation ’ s most populous state on a centrist path , praised Clinton ’ s rival , U.S . Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , but noted that she had won about 3 million more votes and hundreds more delegates . “ In other words , Clinton ’ s lead is insurmountable and Democrats have shown – by millions of votes – that they want her as their nominee. ” California is the biggest prize of the six states that hold presidential nominating contests on June 7 , with 475 delegates . Clinton has secured 2,310 delegates , 73 short of the number needed to clinch her party ’ s nomination for the Nov. 8 election . As he noted in his letter , Brown himself waged a populist presidential campaign in 1992 , losing to then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton , with themes similar to many espoused by Sanders , a self-described democratic socialist . Running on the slogan “ We the People , ” Brown railed against the influence of money in Washington and said politicians were “ bought and paid for. ” But Brown said Democrats need to stop fighting each other so they can focus on beating Trump , who he said presents a danger to immigrants , the environment and world peace . “ The stakes couldn ’ t be higher . Our country faces an existential threat from climate change and the spread of nuclear weapons . A new Cold War is on the horizon , ” Brown wrote . “ Hillary Clinton , with her long experience , especially as secretary of state , has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on day one . ”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama , highlighting his pledge to send people to Mars by the 2030s , on Tuesday announced further public-private efforts to build habitats that could help humans live long-term far from the Earth . “ We are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space . These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth - something we ’ ll need for the long journey to Mars , ” Obama said in an opinion piece on CNN ’ s website . His comments come ahead of a meeting planned by the White House in Pittsburgh this week to team up scientists , students and others to advance the commercial space market , Obama said . NASA separately said it was coordinating with commercial space companies to develop “ deep space habitat modules ” and create opportunities for companies to use the International Space Station ’ s docking port . Obama has previously sought to boost space exploration and renewed that pledge on Tuesday : “ We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America ’ s story in space : sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth , with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. ” The two-term president ’ s recommitment comes in the final months of his tenure and faces an uncertain future after he leaves office in January . His successors will be chosen on Nov. 8 in an election that could also reshape Congress , which allocates government funding . Obama , a self-described “ nerd ” who last year hosted budding astronomers at the White House , has made known his love of space . Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her rival , Republican Donald Trump , have given little , if any , attention to the issue on the campaign trail . Humans have yet to travel to Mars , Earth ’ s neighbor some 35 million miles ( 56 million km ) away . Like Earth , the so-called Red Planet also has seasons , and a 2012 National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) mission found conditions there once supported microbial life , according to the U.S. space agency . It would take about eight months to get there , depending on rocket velocity , according to NASA experts . Efforts to fund the space program have faltered in recent years over concerns about fiscal priorities . As part of the space habitat effort , NASA said on Tuesday it was entering the so-called “ proving ground ” stage to demonstrate and test various technologies over the next 10 years .',\n",

We will never forget the night before the election at the very last rally for candidate Trump TED NUGENT WAS THERE AND PLAYED HIS HEART OUT ! Conservative rocker Ted Nugent , who once told a concert crowd that Barack Obama should suck on [ his ] machine gun , says its unfair to compare him to embattled comedian Kathy Griffin . There s no comparison whatsoever , Mr. Nugent said during a radio interview Wednesday on The Ben Ferguson Show , The Washington Examiner reported . We re talking apples and grenades here , he said . What Kathy Griffin did was downright vulgar , obscene , and a genuine variation of a death threat . I ve never threatened anybody .

       " 'MANILA - The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country s war on drugs , saying officers fired only in self-defence and the death toll reflected the danger and the scale of the narcotics problem . National police chief Ronald dela Rosa was responding to a Special Report that spent four months examining killings by one group of policemen from or near Davao City , the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte . Dela Rosa said police district 6 in Quezon City had Metro Manila s most serious drug problem and he personally sent squad commander Lito Patay there because he was a very professional and very dedicated officer capable of dealing with it . Patay handpicked and headed a unit of 10 men who called themselves the Davao Boys , which racked up the highest number of kills in Quezon City , a violent frontline in Duterte s ferocious anti-narcotics campaign . Police station 6 officers killed 108 people in anti-drug operations from July 2016 through June 2017 , the campaign s first year , accounting for 39 percent of Quezon City s body count , according to official crime reports analyzed by Reuters . A majority of the killings were carried out by the squad run by Patay , who was reassigned to Quezon City just a few weeks after Duterte unleashed his crackdown . He ( Patay ) was chosen because I have big trust in him , he has the balls to face the problems . He will fight , dela Rosa told reporters . He is not an officer who is after money , who will be assigned in an area only to collect money , he is not that kind of officer . He has focus . I assigned him there because I know he can deliver . Asked about the high rate of killings in areas under Patay , he said deaths were inevitable where the drugs trade was rampant . So what s the problem ? The worst drug problem is there in station 6 , so if you hit the problem head on , you face the problem head on then , there would always result in casualties , he said . Nearly 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed in anti-drug operations since July 2016 . Police reject activists allegations they have executed drug users and peddlers and say they kill only when their lives are in danger . Dela Rosa said Patay has since been reassigned to another province to make him eligible for promotion , reflecting his success in convincing drug suspects in Quezon City to surrender to the authorities . He said Patay had been given a free hand at station 6 and had command responsibility over his operations . It is his own call whatever he does there , he has to solve the drug problem , dela Rosa said . The story of the Davao Boys also highlights a larger dynamic : Many of the drug war s key police officers - dela Rosa included - hail from or served in Duterte s hometown , where the campaign s brutal methods originated during his time as mayor . Duterte has repeatedly denied he ordered the killings of criminals and drug dealers during his 22 years as Davao mayor , or his 17 months as president . Dela Rosa appeared frustrated when asked by a reporter if he personally had ordered the deaths of drug suspects in Quezon City . He said Patay s men had no alternative but to kill armed criminals who refused to go quietly . He was placed there to address the drug problem , and not to kill those who deserved to be killed , he said of Patay . If they resist , why would you risk your life ? You have to fight back .',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK - If Hillary Clinton decided to run as an independent for New York City mayor this year , she would open with a sizable lead over incumbent Democrat Bill de Blasio , according to Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday . Clinton led de Blasio 49 percent to 30 percent in the survey of 1,138 city voters . It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points , meaning results could vary that much either way . Since Democrat Clinton ’ s loss to Republican President-elect Donald Trump in November , there has been speculation that the former U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York state might set her sights on the New York City mayoralty this year . Political analysts have dismissed the rumors , saying there is little chance Clinton , 69 , would seek de Blasio ’ s office after coming so close to winning the White House . Clinton ’ s camp has not denied the possibility outright , though advisers have said they do not expect her to seek public office again . A spokesman for de Blasio ’ s re-election campaign and a Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment . The poll may also be a reflection of de Blasio ’ s public standing , which has had its ups and downs during his four-year term . Forty-five percent of those surveyed approved of de Blasio , while a nearly identical 46 percent did not . Nevertheless , the poll showed de Blasio ahead of other possible challengers , including former city council speaker Christine Quinn , who lost to de Blasio in the 2013 Democratic primary , and City Comptroller Scott Stringer . “ New Yorkers aren ’ t in love with Mayor Bill de Blasio , but they seem to like him better than other possible choices – except Hillary Clinton , who probably is an impossible choice , ” Tim Malloy , the poll ’ s assistant director , said in a statement . The poll was apparently the first major survey to include Clinton as a potential mayoral candidate . New York City has never had a female mayor . In the Nov. 8 presidential election , Clinton captured more than 80 percent of New York City votes , even though Trump was born and raised in the heavily Democratic city . She moved in 1999 to Chappaqua , New York , about 30 miles north of the city , in order to run for the U.S. Senate .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Senate Republicans pushing to overhaul Obamacare largely ignored key players in the debate over insuring the poor : the health insurers and hospitals charged with carrying out the law if it gets approved . Instead , conservative groups such as Heritage Action for America won the ears of Senate Republicans when it came to changing the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled . The snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for Medicaid , and threatens to further frustrate the months-long effort to dismantle Obamacare . The latest version of the Senate bill , released on Thursday , left the Medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the U.S. House of Representatives . A nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly $ 800 billion in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years . While insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets , the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on Medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals . These groups , along with insurers , will be charged with enforcing the new law , so Republicans need their buy-in , health policy experts say . “ A health policy means nothing if it can ’ t be implemented and doesn ’ t work , ” said Andy Slavitt , former administrator under President Barack Obama of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which oversaw Obamacare . The Republican bill ends Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion and slashes traditional Medicaid funding , with cuts that deepen beginning in 2025 . The U.S. House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation in May . “ A lot of conservatives , Heritage Action included , desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the Medicaid portion wasn ’ t watered down in the Senate , ” said Dan Holler , vice president of Heritage Action for America , a conservative advocacy group . “ It was something we made known to folks up in the Senate. ” When Democrats and the White House enacted Obamacare seven years ago , support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through Congress . The administration actively courted the health industry , lobbyists and former Obama administration officials said , viewing their support as critical to winning votes . While health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with Republican lawmakers , they said their input on the bill ’ s Medicaid changes was largely ignored . A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not immediately available for comment . In 2017 , the top hospital , doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than $ 13 million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of 2017 , according to a congressional lobbying database . One hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by Republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support . That has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market . Insurers , including some of the biggest providers of Obamacare individual plans , Anthem Inc ( ANTM.N ) and Molina Healthcare ( MOH.N ) , have been asking for changes to specific policies . For instance , the Senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate , the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee . In its place , insurers received one of their biggest demands : a provision in the bill that provides incentives for Americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse . If that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes , lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to Medicaid , said Elizabeth Carpenter , senior vice president at Avalere Health , a consultant group to hospitals and insurers “ The rubber meets the road on the Medicaid provision , ” Carpenter said .',\n",

       " 'Justice Antonin Scalia had an impressive career . In his decades-long appointment as a Supreme Court Justice , he has worked diligently against the forces of social justice . Scalia s insane originalist philosophy has had a major impact on modern conservatism . Luckily , President Obama will now have the opportunity to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice , which will tip the scales in favor of a liberal court.Here is a look back on ten of the worst Supreme Court Decisions of Scalia s career . Sometimes his opinions were in the majority . The ones that were in dissent were oftentimes vicious.In Bush v. Gore , the Supreme Court decided to stop recounting ballots in Florida . This decision is considered by many to be the reason George W. Bush became the president , with everything that came after . Scalia voted in concurrence with majority , and wrote : The issue is not , as the dissent puts it , whether [ c ] ounting every legally cast vote ca [ n ] constitute irreparable harm . One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are , under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law , legally cast vote [ s ] . The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner , and to the country , by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election . Count first , and rule upon legality afterwards , is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires . 2 . Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , 2010 : In Citizen United v. Federal Election Commission , the Supreme Court decided that corporations are people . This created the situation we are in now , where corporations can donate unlimited amounts of money to SuperPACS , which are used to influence political elections . Scalia voted in concurrence with the majority , and wrote : Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent s approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked , and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations ; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion . Most of the Founders resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed . Modern corporations do not have such privileges , and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Founders excluding , perhaps , Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society . 3 . Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , 2014 : In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , the Supreme Court decided that private businesses can be exempted from certain laws on religious grounds . Justice Scalia voted with the opinion of the court . During the case s oral argument , Scalia said : Well , religious beliefs aren t reasonable . I mean , religious beliefs are categorical . You know , it s God tells you . It s not a matter of being reasonable . God be reasonable ? He s supposed to have a full beard . 4 . King v. Burwell , 2015 : In King v. Burwell , the Supreme Court decided that subsidies under Obamacare could be used through the federal exchange program . Scalia dissented , saying : We should start calling this law SCOTUScare [ T ] his Court s two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others , and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites . 5 . Shelby County v. Holder , 2013 : In Shelby County v. Holder , the Supreme Court decided to strike down parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . This weakened the Voting Rights Act and is considered by many an attack on the civil liberties of black voters . Scalia said , in 2013 in a speech at the University of California Washington Center , the following : Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements , it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes . Even the name of it is wonderful , the Voting Rights Act . Who s going to vote against that ? 6 . Obergefell v. Hodges , 2015 : In Obergrefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court decided that same-sex couples have the right to get married . Scalia dissented from the opinion of the court , saying : Those civil consequences and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences can perhaps have adverse social effects , but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws . So it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage . It is of overwhelming importance , however , who it is that rules me . Today s decree says that my Ruler , and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast , is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court . 7 . Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 1992 : In Planned Parenthood v. Casey , challenges were made to Pennsylvania law that required women to meet certain provisions in order to have an abortion . The court found that the provisions were unconstitutional , except for one that required women to notify their husband . Justice Scalia dissented gainst the opinion of the court , saying : The States may , if they wish , permit abortion on demand , but the Constitution does not require them to do so . The permissibility of abortion , and the limitations upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting . 8 . Lawrence v. Texas , 2003 : In this Supreme Court decision , a law that banned sodomy was struck down . Scalia dissented from the opinion of the court . He wrote : Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business , as scoutmasters for their children , as teachers in their children s schools , or as boarders in their home , he wrote . They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive . 9 . Romer v. Evans , 1996 : In Romer v. Evans , the Supreme Court decided that the state of Colorado could not prevent local jurisdictions from creating laws that prohibit discrimination against LGBT people , Scalia dissented , saying : [ Colorado s ban ] prohibits special treatment of homosexuals , and nothing more . [ I ] t would prevent the State or any municipality from making death benefit payments to the life partner of a homosexual when it does not make such payments to the long time roommate of a nonhomosexual employee . 10 . Wal-Mart v. Dukes , 2011 : In Wal-Mart v. Dukes , the Supreme court made the decision that ended one of the largest class-action suits in history . More than 1.5 million women filed a class action suit against Wal-Mart claiming gender discrimination . Scalia voted with the majority of the court and delivered their opinion . Scalia said : Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company aside from their reliance on Dr. Bielby s social frameworks analysis that we have rejected . In a company of Wal-Mart s size and geographical scope , it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction . Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence , but their evidence falls well short . Republicans are already hard at work trying to prevent President Obama from appointing Scalia s replacement . Their efforts are in vain . There is no legitimate reason President Obama should not appoint Scalia s replacement . Luckily for everyone , it is likely that President Obama s replacement can undo much of the harm that Scalia has done during his career.Featured image from Donkey Hotey via Flickr',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of a pipeline project near a North Dakota Indian reservation , which has been the subject of months of protests by tribes and environmentalists . A communications briefing from Trump ’ s transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners , the company building the pipeline , Trump ’ s support of the pipeline “ has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans. ” “ Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that President-elect Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on Day One , ” said the daily briefing note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff . Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $ 3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites . On Thursday , U.S. military veterans were arriving at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest the pipeline . Republican Trump has been a vocal supporter of another high-profile pipeline project , Transcanada ’ s Keystone XL , which Democratic President Barack Obama denied a permit for last year . Republican North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said he met with Trump ’ s transition team to discuss the delayed pipeline . “ Today , Mr. Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline , which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers , ” Hoeven said in a statement . “ It is important to know that the new administration will work to help us grow and diversify our energy economy and build the energy infrastructure necessary to move it from where it is produced to where it is needed , ” he said .',\n",
       " \"What a treat ! Laura Ingraham interviewed President Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller tonight : Miller has been spot on from the beginning of his tenure as Senior Adviser to Trump He often warmed up the Trump rally crowds with incredibly uplifting speeches . He also gave a great speech about why not to vote for Hillary : Trump spokesperson Stephen Miller just hammers Hillary Clinton ! You will love every minute of this ! The guy is so dialed in on immigration and what needs to be done to reform it . One million people come into the U.S. yearly ! 300K in the 70 s , 500K in the 80 s and now 1 million ! NUTS ! Ingraham pivots to speak about polls and the media Note that he calls the media the extreme media LOL ! Who doesn t love that new term ? Ingraham discusses Trump s agenda and the populist movement . It s about trade , immigration , public safety to help ALL Americans.Uplifing everyone is the key ! SOME BACKGROUND ON MILLER S RISE TO TRUMP S INNER CIRCLE : When Jeff Sessions first looked at Stephen Miller , he saw potential in the recent Duke University graduate.Miller , then in his early 20s , took up an offer from the conservative author David Horowitz to visit Capitol Hill to introduce him to members of Congress . Horowitz believed that Miller , who penned conservative columns at Duke and in Horowitz Front Page Mag , would be a capable D.C. staffer . A meeting with Sessions was on the top of Miller s Washington wish list . What was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting became an hour-long meeting with the senator , Stephen Boyd , Sessions former communications director who eventually hired Miller . Sen . Sessions immediately saw that Stephen Miller was an extraordinary young man who had a deep grasp of conservative politics . It wasn t only Sessions who saw something in Miller.When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Friday , the 31-year-old Miller will be one of the president s closest confidants , serving as a senior White House advisor . That title , announced last month , comes after Miller worked as a senior policy advisor for the better part of a year on the Trump campaign . Trump also tasked Miller with writing his speech to the Republican National Convention , and initial reports indicated that Miller would be writing the inaugural address . The Trump camp is now saying that the president-elect wrote that one himself , although New York Magazine poked some holes in that claim.While Sessions did not have an opening for Miller at the time of that first meeting nearly 10 years ago , he told Boyd to put him on his radar . He came out and he said to me , I want you to keep an eye on him and see if he can be a part of our team one day , ' Boyd recalled . After working as a press secretary to two House members , Miller was hired as a communications staffer on the Judiciary Committee , where Sessions was the top Republican . I remember setting up a staff and it was Friday afternoon , and I got the go-ahead to hire a press secretary just to work on Judiciary . [ Sessions ] directions were very clear and he and I discussed it that it was obvious this was a kid with a lot of talent , Boyd said.Miller would move up the ranks from a Judiciary Committee staffer to press secretary for Sessions office , eventually rising to communications director when Boyd departed to become chief of staff to Rep. Martha Roby , R-Montgomery , in 2012 . Miller could not be reached for this story.On the surface , there didn t seem to be much in common between Sessions , who grew up near Selma , and Miller , who was raised in liberal Southern California.The turning point for Miller came after the Sept. 11 attacks , when he was disgusted with how his high school in Santa Monica ridiculed President George W. Bush and how the liberal-leaning faculty banned conservatives like Horowitz and talk show host Larry Elder from speaking at the school but allowed leftists and a Communist to address the student body , according to an interview he gave to the Los Angeles Times . During that dreadful time of national tragedy , anti-Americanism had spread all over the school like a rash , Miller wrote in a 2003 essay , How I Changed My Left Wing High School , which Horowitz published . The co-principal broadcasted his doubts about the morality of the air strikes against the Taliban to the entire school via the PA system . One teacher even dragged the American flag across the floor as we were sending off brave young men to risk their lives for it . It was then that I first took action , writing to prized radio personality Larry Elder . He invited me to discuss these issues on his program , which immediately drew the ire of the teachers , administrators , and even my fellow students . Their resistance only strengthened my resolve . Miller continued his conservative advocacy at Duke , when he gained attention for defending the white lacrosse players accused of raping a black stripper ( the players were ultimately exonerated ) at a time when public opinion was against them . His position led to appearances on cable news , further raising his profile . Three of our fellow students are being put on trial not because of evidence but because of a DA s incompetence and malice , he wrote in the university s student paper . Sadly , many in the community have shown that they are not fair minded but would rather hunt for witches than search for justice . Miller s writings were one of the main factors in Boyd hiring him . I focused on his material he had written for the other two members of the House . I was very impressed he had a column in college and he was a very good writer , Boyd recalled . I was impressed with his intellect , I was impressed with his grasp of politics . I was impressed with his ability to get the core of the matter and articulate it in a way [ the public would ] understand . Sessions office later found out that Miller had an uncanny ability to channel the senator s when dealing with the press . Colleagues of Miller s and Sessions told Politico that the two had a mind meld , a quality that Boyd also attested to . Miller has demonstrated an ability to capture the voice of his boss in a way that is very important and also exceeds the ability of most Capitol Hill staff , Boyd said.That voice was mostly flexed on immigration , where explained Sessions views to the public.When his boss was accused by pro-immigration groups of being a demagogue for his opposition to an unsuccessful 2010 bill to grant illegal immigrants amnesty for enrolling in college or enlisting in the military , Miller stuck to the issue instead of responding with another attack . The DREAM Act is a proposal for mass amnesty that would even include those who have committed serious criminal offenses , he told AL.com in November 2010 . It would add millions of newly authorized workers at a time when Americans are struggling with high unemployment and recession . Besides being a conduit between the senator and the media , Miller also played a role on policy matters ; he was instrumental in helping Sessions derail the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2014 that would have given illegals a pathway to citizenship . Miller helped put together a briefing book for Republicans filled with talking points and data to bolster their case . We had been working on the ideas in it for months , and Stephen put it in the handbook in a very quick time in a very cogent fashion , Sessions told Politico . It was very timely and it impacted the outcome of the vote . Boyd said Miller s involvement on policy was unusual for a communications staffer . It is rare , although in his case I think it speaks to his grasp on the issues and his understanding as they impact the average man and woman , Boyd said . There s no doubt that there was a great trust between Sen . Sessions toward Stephen Miller and they made a great team . Miller s having switched to a high-level position on Trump s team at a relatively young age does not come as a shock to Boyd , who said his former colleague has adeptly articulated Trump s views . I think personally that Miller was one of the first people to really understand the deep frustration that the American working class is feeling , their concerns with open borders and trade policies that hurt them more than they help , and also brought an ability to channel that energy toward president-elect Trump , he said.Steve Bannon , former Breitbart News CEO and Trump s campaign manager who will join Miller in the White House as chief advisor to the president , said Sessions work in the Senate with Miller s input paved the way for Trump s candidacy . Whether the issue was trade or immigration or radical Islam , for many years before Donald Trump came on the scene , Sen . Sessions was the leader of the movement and Stephen was his right-hand man , Bannon told Politico in their June profile of Miller.What started out as the potential of a recent college graduate has turned into high expectations for Miller .\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug-dependent newborns and assist their parents . The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nation ’ s heroin and opioid drug epidemic . Obama said in a statement that 78 Americans die from opioid overdose every day , and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic . “ I am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need , ” Obama said . “ In fact , they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $ 920 million in treatment funding. ” The bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate . Efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a investigation last year titled “ Helpless & Hooked. ” The new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored . That law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report , track and assist drug-dependent newborns and their families . found that no more than nine states were following that requirement . Most children born to addicted mothers , including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone , were not being reported by hospitals as required by law . Often , that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services , as the existing law requires . When cases were reported to social services , found , efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited . The failures came at a cost . found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them . Experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted . The new law promises a non-punitive approach that includes “ safe care plans ” aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents , who will receive additional help . “ This is a step forward for vulnerable babies who , due to an opioid dependency , will begin their lives facing enormous challenges , ” said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania , the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on children and families . “ Reuters ’ initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives . There is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward. ” Representative John Kline , a Minnesota Republican who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce , which initiated the measure , said it will track state actions . “ These reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nation ’ s opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future , ” Kline said in a statement . In 2013 , the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting , 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome , a five-fold increase from a decade earlier . found that one drug-dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the United States . Some suffer shaking , crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal . Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , said the broader addiction law was “ no more than a half measure ” without more funding . Wyden has co-sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children . It passed the House but stalled in the Senate . Jim Greenwood , a former Pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law , said the deaths revealed represent “ a national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal , state and local level to implement Plans of Safe Care for infants. ” Greenwood , now president of a Washington , D.C.-based biotechnology group , applauded the new measure “ to improve the health and safety of these babies and their families. ” Stephen Patrick , an assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University and leading researcher on the condition , said the new law is “ good news ” but added : “ Wish there was funding that came with it . ”',\n",
       " \"These are people who claim to love diversity , and they don t love diversity they just want people to agree with them . Ferguson playwright Phelim McAleerVeteran actor Philip Casnoff hadn t read the full script yet when he arrived for the first rehearsal of Ferguson , a play chronicling the shooting of Michael Brown by a Missouri police officer.Casnoff thought he knew what the play , set for a four-day staged reading starting Sunday at the Odyssey Theater , would be about : the wilderness of testimony the grand jury navigated while investigating the day Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old . Casnoff presumed a variety of viewpoints , the fog of truth.Then he read the script , which tells the story that Brown didn t have his hands up and that he charged at Wilson.Now , in a case of art imitating life , the play is experiencing the kind of ill will and mistrust that erupted from the city it attempts to portray . Part of the 13-member cast is in revolt Casnoff and four others have quit as the playwright and actors are locked in a fundamental disagreement over how to tell the story of Brown s death.Though the grand jury declined to indict Wilson after some witnesses and physical evidence supported his account of events , the tone of the play shocked some actors . It felt like the purpose of the piece was to show , Of course he was not indicted here s why , ' Casnoff said . He said that after he learned who the play s author was , Casnoff , who describes himself as very liberal , left-wing-leaning , thought , Whoa , this is not the place for me to be . Through testimony taken from grand jury transcripts , the play ends with a witness telling a prosecutor that Wilson was justified in killing Brown . The audience is then supposed to vote on whether Wilson should have been indicted.The cast members who quit questioned the motivations of the playwright , Phelim McAleer.McAleer , a conservative filmmaker and journalist from Ireland now living in Marina del Rey , said he s just interested in the truth . The truth is the truth . If it doesn t fit in with their beliefs , they need to change their beliefs , said McAleer , who declined to say whether Wilson should have been indicted but said his research shows the hands-up claim is bogus . All the people who testified that he had his hands up , it was pretty much demolished in grand jury testimony . If the rest of the decidedly more liberal cast resigns some actors are leaning that way McAleer said he ll find a new cast . He also hopes to put the show on YouTube and bring the production to Ferguson itself . There s got to be some actors in L.A. who aren t scared of controversy , he said.During the Ferguson rehearsal , the performers balked after realizing the only witness in McAleer s play who says Brown had his hands up is immediately discredited by an FBI agent . ( Although some witnesses told investigators that Brown had his hands up , a Department of Justice report said many of those witnesses accounts were recanted , debunked or inconsistent with physical evidence . ) McAleer s play also ends with a damning exchange between a witness and prosecutor . Do you feel like this could have ended up any other way ? the prosecutor asks . Yeah , it could have , if Michael Brown had just stopped running toward Wilson , says the witness , who is identified as Witness 48 in the grand jury transcripts , but who is given a pseudonym in the play and cast with a young black actress . It could have ended another way . The officer had no other choice . No other choice , in other words , but to shoot Brown.After those lines were read by actors Deborah Puette and Sydney A. Mason , a kind of awkward quiet fell over the cast members , whose bodies had been bent like question marks as they stared down at their scripts in a rehearsal space near Culver City.The cast questioned the balance of the 55-page script , and even debated the justification for the shooting . Why not shoot him in the leg ? asked one actress , Donzaleigh Abernathy , cast to play a witness , her voice booming through the small , windowless space . He didn t have time ! responded a younger actor , also playing a witness.Several members requested changes to the script that would include adding another account more sympathetic to Brown to balance out the final witness dramatic testimony . McAleer has rejected those requests , spurring some of the actors departures . He claims that he wrote this to try to get to the truth of it , but everybody s truth is totally subjective , said Veralyn Jones , an African American cast member who resigned . When you come to the matter of what really happened , nobody really knows for sure , because everybody has a different take on it . It just didn t feel right to me . One of the script s most heated critics has been Abernathy , who is the daughter of civil rights movement leader Ralph David Abernathy , who was with the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. when he died . Abernathy , who is black , has not decided to leave the cast yet at least not before she has the chance to meet McAleer at a cast meeting scheduled for Thursday night . I want to hear what he has to say face to face . I actually want to know , on a moral level , how can you do something like this that you know will divide America ? Abernathy asked . Does it make you feel good ? Obviously he has a personal agenda . What is his personal agenda ? McAleer was unapologetic , and waved away criticism . These are people who claim to love diversity , and they don t love diversity they just want people to agree with them , he said.So with or without his cast , McAleer said , the show will go on.Via : LA Times\",\n",
       " '- With golf long regarded as a stern measure of character and a natural setting for deal-making , U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’ s weekend outing in Florida could be viewed as more than a leisurely bonding exercise between two world leaders . U.S. President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Abe will form a twosome for their round of golf on Saturday , presumably at the Trump International Golf Club near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach . Details are still under wraps . Trump told a local sports radio station last weekend golf was a better way to get to know someone than lunch and saw his match-up with Abe as a “ fun ” meeting between partners rather than adversaries . Abe might feel the occasion carries more weight . His prime minister grandfather , Nobusuke Kishi , and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower played near Washington in 1957 , a round newspapers described as a “ triumph of diplomacy ” between former World War Two enemies . Abe teed off the latest round of golf diplomacy in November , giving Trump an expensive , gold-colored driver during their meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan , where he sought assurances about the future strength of the decades-old alliance between the two nations . With anxiety over Trump ’ s tough talk on currency , security and trade with Japan , some in Tokyo have expressed concern Abe might be too generous in any haggling on the fairways when pitted against the real estate mogul and author of “ The Art of the Deal ” . In purely a golfing sense , Abe is likely to find Trump a formidable opponent . “ He is pretty remarkable for a 70-year-old guy , ” Jaime Diaz , editor-in-chief of Golf World and a senior writer for Golf Digest , told Reuters . “ As I understand it , his handicap is 2.8 . That seems a little low but I think he is very capable of playing to a five or six handicap . “ He is a legitimate good player . It ’ s not a ‘ trumped-up ’ claim that he is somebody who shoots in the 70s. ” Trump says he has won 18 club trophies and said such a winning pedigree made him the ideal man to run the country during the election race . “ See how beautiful my hands are , look at those hands . Those are powerful hands , ” Trump said at a Detroit rally last year during the Republican primaries . “ ( They can ) hit a golf ball 285 yards. ” Retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya questioned Trump ’ s trustworthiness on the golf course while speaking to reporters in Las Vegas in May 2016 during the build-up to the WBC middleweight title clash between Canelo Alvarez and Amir Khan , according to the AP . Hollywood actor Samuel L. Jackson did the same in an interview he did with United Airlines ’ Rhapsody magazine in January 2016. could not independently confirm these accounts . After the Jackson interview , Trump issued a tweet that said in part : “ I don ’ t cheat at golf. ” The White House did not return a request for comment on the cheating allegations . Diaz who has twice played with Trump , at Trump National Golf Club Charlotte in North Carolina in 2013 and more recently at the Doral resort in Florida , described the President as someone who would not need to resort to cheating to beat most players . “ I know he has won all these club championships at golf courses that he owns and a lot of people are suspect about that . But he would be a tough guy to beat with a five handicap , ” the golf writer said . “ He addresses the ball with good body language ... confident and flowing and fluid . He just looks like he is going to hit a good shot. ” It is far harder to find allegations of cheating or boastfulness directed at the more circumspect Abe , who is a member of the ultra-exclusive Three Hundred Club in Kanagawa Prefecture , south-west of Tokyo . The club , confined to only 300 members , charges some 70-80 million yen ( $ 625,000- $ 715,000 ) for membership fees and 50,000 yen for green fees . The 62-year-old Abe takes the game very seriously and local media have reported that rounds with his wife can get tense if he is playing poorly . “ When he is playing golf , he concentrates . So everyone else becomes intense as well , ” a company president who plays Abe once or twice a year , told on condition of anonymity . He was unsure of Abe ’ s handicap but confirmed reports that the Prime Minister usually shoots between 90 and 100 over 18 holes , which would place him squarely in the field of average weekend hackers . A straight driver with a “ stable ” game all round , Abe is generally smartly turned out , sometimes in short pants and knee socks and always with a baseball cap on his head . “ I was impressed that Abe holds the flag on the green , while other players are putting , ” the source said . “ People in a high position like him do not have to do that for others . He is very polite. ” The conservative politician is not so reserved as to shun refreshments at the ‘ 19th hole ’ back at the clubhouse , however , where he might indulge in a couple of glasses of beer or red wine after a bath to freshen up , added the source .

       " 'OMAHA , Neb . - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday campaigned alongside U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rowdy rally in his home state of Nebraska , where he challenged Republican Donald Trump to release his tax returns and questioned Trump ’ s business acumen . Trump , a New York real estate developer making his first run at public office , has said he can not release his tax returns , a ritual of U.S. presidential campaigns , until the Internal Revenue Service has completed an audit . “ Now I ’ ve got news for him , ” said Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) conglomerate is based in Omaha . “ I ’ m under audit , too , and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace , anytime , before the election . “ I ’ ll bring my tax return , he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions about the items that are on there , ” Buffett added , saying Trump was “ afraid ” not of the tax-collecting IRS but of voters . In response , Trump ’ s spokeswoman Hope Hicks said : “ As you know , Mr. Trump is undergoing a routine audit. ” She had no immediate comment when asked to respond to Buffett saying that he too was under audit but would release his tax returns . Trump has asserted his success as a businessman qualifies him to lead the country , but Buffett , who backs Clinton in the Nov. 8 election , said Trump lost money the only time he went to the American people and asked them to invest . He said it was in 1995 when Trump listed his Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange . He said the company lost money every year for the next decade . A monkey would have outperformed Trump ’ s company , Buffett said . In 1995 , “ if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page , the monkey on average would have made 150 percent , ” he said . Buffett spoke for nearly 30 minutes to a raucous capacity crowd of roughly 3,100 people in a suburban Omaha high school with Clinton sitting at his side . He said Trump ’ s “ final straw ” was an ABC interview broadcast on Sunday in which he criticized the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago . The father Khizr Khan spoke at last week ’ s Democratic National Convention about their son and attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States . Trump said he was “ viciously ” attacked by Khan , a naturalized U.S. citizen , when the father publicly doubted Trump had read the U.S. Constitution . Khan said that Trump had “ sacrificed nothing , ” prompting Trump in his ABC interview to say , “ I think I ’ ve made a lot of sacrifices. ” Buffett on Monday bluntly contradicted Trump . “ No member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan . No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan , ” Buffett said . “ We ’ ve both done extremely well during this period and our families haven ’ t sacrificed anything. ” In his remarks Buffett announced the launch of a get-out-the vote effort , pledging to take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there . Buffett said he was backing a website , Drive2Vote , that would coordinate transportation to cast votes and that he had reserved a trolley that seats 32 people for the same purpose . “ I ’ m going to be on it all day . I ’ m going to do selfies , whatever it takes , ” Buffett said . Buffett said his goal is to generate the highest voter turnout in the congressional district that includes Omaha of any in the country . Nebraska is one of two U.S. states that award electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district . Clinton responded to Buffett ’ s pledge with a promise of her own , if his turnout goal is met . “ Warren and I will dance in the streets of Omaha together ! Maybe if we ’ re really lucky he ’ ll wear his Elvis costume again ! ” she said .',\n",
       " 'One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week . That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein . He was found dead in his Miami home with a gunshot to the head that s been ruled a suicide by the Miami-Dade s medical examiner records supervisor . ( Think Vince Foster ) Klaus Eberwein , a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week , has been found dead in Miami . He was 50.Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.Eberwein , who had acknowledged his life was in danger , was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation s activities in the Caribbean island , where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency , Fonds d assistance conomique et social , for three years.According to Eberwein , a paltry 0.6 % of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations . A further 9.6 % ended up with the Haitian government . The remaining 89.8 % or $ 5.4 billion was funneled to non-Haitian organizations . The Clinton Foundation , they are criminals , they are thieves , they are liars , they are a disgrace , Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.The former director general of Haiti , who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly , was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti , Muncheez , and even has a pizza the Klaus Special named after him.According to the Haiti Libre newspaper , Eberwein was said to be in good spirits , with plans for the future . His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide . It s really shocking , said Muncheez s owner Gilbert Bailly . We grew up together ; he was like family . Your News WireAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016 , former Senate President of Haiti , Bernard Sansaricq , shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti , FL . Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office . To his credit , candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind , and to expose the crimes of the Clinton s , who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti . His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to side with the Clinton Administration and he would be the richest man in Haiti . He also demanded that Hillary Clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the Haiti earthquake crisis , as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation . Not even 2 % of that money went back to Haiti . So Mr. Trump , we are asking you , begging you , the Haitian community will side with you if one day , you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake . Haiti is a very poor country . Haiti needs defenders . You said you would champion our cause . We welcome you sir and we will work with you . Ask Hillary Clinton publicly , during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti .

       " \"Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the gun show loophole and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns , conservatives have been preparing for war on the President s policies . We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something , something Dark Side . And , of course , as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric , one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday , police in Redding , California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building . According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department , what law enforcement found was sort of expected . A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws . If that s not bad enough , he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window . Once police arrived , he began shooting at them : Officers made verbal contact with the subject , described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system . The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers . Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama . The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up . During this time , officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance . An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful . After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender , the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand , leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment , in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees , the release notes . Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times . The suspect was declared deceased on scene . We heard the five shots everyone was screaming , resident David Rice recalled . He came out screaming Obama ! Obama ! Obama !

       " 'The LA Times is reporting that moviegoing is at the lowest level since 1995 . The article blames Americans who are going to see fewer movies , on streaming services , which , to some extent , could be true , but from the majority of the comments we ve seen on our Facebook page , which reaches almost 1.7 million followers , Americans are no longer interested in paying their hard-earned money to support the anti-American and anti-Trump hate machine that is Hollywood . While there are a few openly conservative actors in Hollywood , the majority of them are swimming in a cesspool of liberalism and are consumed with hate for President Trump and his deplorable supporters . From George Clooney trashing Trump over his stance on refugees coming to America from Muslim hotbed nations , to Meryl Streep using a televised award ceremony to trash our newly inaugurated President , to has-been pop stars like Madonna saying she d like to blow up the White House ; America has had it up to their eyeballs with people who are some of America s top earners , thanks to the support of people they openly mock for supporting President Trump . The LA Times reports , that Hollywood is celebrating the end of 2017 with astronomical sales from Star Wars : The Last Jedi , which is on track to soon exceed $ 1 billion in global ticket sales and eventually become the biggest movie of the year . But that won t be enough to write a happy storyline for the industry.Although movie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to dip just below last year s record of $ 11.38 billion , the number of tickets sold is projected to drop 4 % to 1.26 billion the lowest level since 1995 , according to preliminary estimates from studio executives.The falloff in ticket sales can mostly be explained by a handful of movies that flopped , especially during the dreary summer season that posted the worst results in more than two decades . Even such massive hits as Wonder Woman , Thor : Ragnarok and It couldn t make up for a lackluster summer lineup populated by rickety franchises ( Alien : Covenant ) and poorly reviewed retreads ( The Mummy ) .However , the long-term decline in attendance reflects systemic challenges facing the industry . Audiences are spending less time going to the movies and are consuming more entertainment on small screens and through streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon that are spending billions on original video content.Sorry to burst your liberal bubble , but now that the curtain has been pulled back , the deplorable crowd isn t interested in supporting hate-filled , liberal Hollywood . Deal with it',\n",
       " 'SEOUL - The heir to South Korea s Samsung Group , convicted of bribing the country s former president , appeared in a packed court on Thursday for the first day of arguments in the appeal of his five-year jail term for corruption . The 49-year-old Jay Y. Lee was convicted by a lower court in August of bribing Park Geun-hye , who was dismissed as president in March . The court decided the bribe helped Lee strengthen his control of the crown jewel in the conglomerate , Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) , one of the world s biggest technology companies . The appellate court hearing the appeal is likely to try to rule on the case by next February , legal experts said . Whichever side loses could take the case to the Supreme Court , the final court of appeal in South Korea . Lee s presence marked his first public appearance since the August ruling . He did not speak during the proceedings other than giving his birth date and address . The lower court in August had ruled that while Lee never asked for Park s help directly , the fact that a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates did help cement Lee s control over Samsung Electronics implied he was asking for the president s help to strengthen his control of the firm . Lee , sitting mostly expressionless in a dark suit without tie , listened to hours-long PowerPoint presentations by both sides arguing over the lower court s logic that Lee s actions implied solicitation for help from Park by providing financial support for Park s close friend and confidante Choi Soon-sil . On Thursday , the defense strongly challenged that logic . In order for implied solicitation to exist , there needed to have been a level of wordless understanding between Lee and the former president that transcended speaking , said Lee In-jae , Jay Y. Lee s lead counsel . The prosecution , which has lodged a cross-appeal against the lower court ruling that found Lee innocent on some charges , said the court s decision to not acknowledge explicit solicitation for Park s help from Samsung despite the evidence found did not make sense . The defense , which spent much of its time during the initial trial refuting the prosecution s individual charges , said it will focus on a few key arguments in the appeal - including whether there was in fact an ordinary type of bribery as defined under South Korean law , which says only civil servants come under the statute . Park s friend Choi was not a civil servant . The lower court found that Samsung s financial support of 7.2 billion won ( $ 6.27 million ) to sponsor the equestrian career of Choi s daughter constituted an ordinary type of bribery , as it can be considered the same as she ( Park ) herself receiving it . The defense is expected to strongly challenge this by saying that the prosecution , on whom the burden of proof lies , has not proved collusion between Park and Choi . The appeal hearing continues on Oct 19 .',\n",
       " 'The party s over or is it ? Hillary Clinton and her aides will need to decide whether to lie or tell the truth to the FBI about her e-mail and official business . This puts them in a position of choosing between being honest about those emails , or lying to the FBI , which is a crime , said Matthew G. Whitaker , U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 to 2009 . He is presently executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust ( FACT ) in Washington , D.C.Federal agents are preparing to schedule interviews with Clinton s longtime and closest aides about her use of the private email and server throughout her tenure as the nation s chief diplomat from 2009 to 2013 , the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Despite Clinton s repeated denial she ever sent or received classified information via her private email , federal investigators said more than 2,000 of the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the Department of State did include classified material . More than 20 of those emails contained information so sensitive and classified members of Congress were not allowed to read them.Whitaker s group made public its list of what it judges to be the top 10 most ethically challenged Hillary emails March 10 , 2016 : Nepotism : Clinton intervened Aug. 22 , 2012 , on behalf of her son-in-law , Marc Mezvinsky , in an effort to secure State Department assistance for one of his business associates with ties to a Clinton Foundation donor . FACT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on this issue . Favoring Insiders : Clinton impressed billionaire donor George Soros with his easy access to her , according to a May 12 , 2012 , email to her from Neera Tanden , veteran Clinton adviser and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress . Above The Law : Clinton told aide Jake Sullivan in a June 17 , 2011 , email to disregard classification security regulations and send information for a speech via a non-secure email system , which forced the aide to either break the law or disobey an order . Special Interests : In a July 26 , 2010 , email exchange with Clinton , Sullivan forwarded a message from Jeffrey Farrow , an influential lobbyist for a Pacific island government . The exchange raises red flags about whether Farrow had made requests , according to FACT . Selling Access : A Dec. 10 , 2009 , email discussed attempts by Clinton campaign and foundation donor Brian Greenspun to set up a meeting between Clinton and a top Israeli official who had been trying to meet with [ Clinton ] to no avail . The email suggests certain campaign and foundation donors had a privileged back door to Clinton . Conflicts Of Interest : Clinton pushed for the State Department to work with the Clinton Foundation and the Red Cross on a project in Haiti . The Jan. 19 , 2010 , email from Clinton to Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills indicates a clear conflict of interest , according to FACT . Helping Political Allies : Mark Penn , Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign pollster and long-time political adviser , complained about not having timely access on a corporate event in China . His complaints were apparently resolved after a Feb. 22 , 2010 , email from Clinton aide Kris Balderston that set up a telephone call with Clinton . Trading Favors : Barely a week after the Penn complaint , Balderston reported in a March 2 email to Clinton that major corporations , including Boeing , CITI and Blackstone , agreed to provide financial support for the event . Even the appearance of this sort of favor trading , involving the public , private and political sectors , is a bad ethics practice , according to FACT . Abuse Of Position : A Sept. 15 , 2011 , email forwarded to Clinton , Sullivan and aide Huma Abedin listed multiple State Department officials attending the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative conference despite having no official role . Robert Hormats , a department official , was also a speaker at a dinner co-hosted by the Goldman Sachs Wall Street investment firm that later paid Clinton $ 675,000 for three speeches . The dinner focused on investing in women , Clinton s favorite Clinton Foundation project . Duping Obama : In a Sept. 20 , 2011 , email to Clinton , Mills forwarded a draft of President Barack Obama s planned remarks to the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative . FACT contends that Clinton doesn t appear to have routinely received copies of the President s draft speeches , and it sends bad ethical signals to treat a speech given to her family s organization differently .

       " 'Because after all , what s more offensive than choosing to allow your baby to live ? The pro-life message can be classified as patently offensive , a federal appeals court ruled last week . The new opinion came as a three-judge panel ruled that New York state was right to reject a Choose Life license plate on the grounds that it may grate on New Yorkers political sensibilities.The judges split on whether New York could deny a pro-adoption group the right to have its own license plate , although the state has in the past allowed plates endorsing political causes associated with the liberal viewpoint , such as environmentalism.Judge Rosemary Pooler , who was appointed by President Clinton , wrote that the state s denial did not harm anyone s right to freedom of expression , because drivers may display a Choose Life bumper sticker or even cover every available square inch of their vehicle with such stickers . That message will resonate just as loudly as if vehicle displayed a Choose Life license plate . Judge Debra Ann Livingston , a President George W. Bush appointee , wrote in her dissent that a proposed custom plate depicting a sun and two smiling children , and bearing the words , Choose Life [ thought ] to be patently offensive was surprising . Pro-adoption organizations should have the same speech rights as any other organization . While the district court affirmed this basic freedom , the circuit court denied free speech in favor of government censorship , said Jeremy Tedesco , senior counsel at ADF . The state doesn t have the authority to target The Children First Foundation specialty plates for censorship based on its life-affirming viewpoint . The ruling is the lastest round in a legal battle that has raged for more than a decade and , pro-lifers say , seen state officials repeatedly suppress their First Amendment rights.The Children First Foundation applied for the specialty license plate in 2002 , but state officials say the message and design was too controversial . In 2004 , the Alliance Defending Freedom filed a lawsuit on CFF s behalf.New York s Department of Motor Vehicles repeatedly denied the Choose Life license plates on the grounds that the message was patently offensive . The same appeals court rejected an effort to suppress the plates made by then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and agreed that Albany officials denied the plates based on viewpoint discrimination.Via : LifeSite News',\n",

That will not take place until Thursday , and in the meantime , bombshells keep dropping from the White House especially on the subject of just how troubled Comey was by Trump s behavior . In fact , it seems that Comey was so uneasy that he actually told Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump.The New York Times is reporting that Trump s inappropriate requests for Comey and the FBI to drop certain elements of the Russian hacking investigations made him uncomfortable enough that he went to Sessions and told him that he and his agency needed him to be a firewall of protection from investigation meddling from the West Wing of the White House . Comey , however , never told Sessions specific details of just what had him so worried when it came to Trump ; after all , Sessions and Trump are notoriously close , and it is not a certainty that Sessions is completely trustworthy in these matters , either.When asked about these conversations with the now-former FBI Director , the Department of Justice only said : The attorney general doesn t believe it s appropriate to respond to media inquiries on matters that may be related to ongoing investigations . So , in other words , there s no denial here that these conversations took place . This is quite a development , considering that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was so deeply concerned about the behavior of the nation s chief executive that he simply could not bring himself to be alone in a room with him.Trump s problematic behavior causes Obama Justice Department Official Matthew S.

       " 'YOUNGSTOWN , OHIO - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , who has previously accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low to help President Barack Obama , said on Monday that the U.S. central bank has created a “ false economy ” and that interest rates should change . “ They ’ re keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn ’ t go down , ” Trump said in response to a reporter ’ s request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September . “ We have a very false economy , ” he said . “ At some point the rates are going to have to change , ” Trump , who was campaigning in Ohio on Monday , added . “ The only thing that is strong is the artificial stock market , ” he said . Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that the U.S. central bank was getting closer to raising interest rates , possibly as early as September , saying that the Fed sees the economy as close to meeting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices . The Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time in nearly a decade , and at that time projected four more hikes in 2016 . The Fed later scaled back that projection to two rate hikes this year in the wake of a slowdown in global growth and continued financial market volatility . Trump , during the primary campaign , as he took on 16 Republican rivals , had called Yellen ’ s tenure “ highly political ” and said the Fed should raise interest rates but would not do so for “ political reasons. ” The Fed has been a target of some conservative critics in the U.S. Congress , who say the bank risked sparking inflation with its easy monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis .

       " 'WASHINGTON - Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama ’ s veto of legislation allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia , the first veto override of his presidency , just four months before it ends . The House of Representatives voted 348-77 against the veto , hours after the Senate rejected it 97-1 , meaning the “ Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act ” will become law . The vote was a blow to Obama as well as to Saudi Arabia , one of the United States ’ longest-standing allies in the Arab world , and some lawmakers who supported the override already plan to revisit the issue . Obama said he thought the Congress had made a mistake , reiterating his belief that the legislation set a dangerous precedent and indicating that he thought political considerations were behind the vote . “ If you ’ re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election , not surprisingly , that ’ s a hard vote for people to take . But it would have been the right thing to do , ” he said on CNN . Obama ’ s 11 previous vetoes were all sustained . But this time almost all his strongest Democratic supporters in Congress joined Republicans to oppose him in one of their last actions before leaving Washington to campaign for the Nov. 8 election . “ Overriding a presidential veto is something we don ’ t take lightly , but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice , even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts , ” Senator Charles Schumer , a top Senate Democrat , said in a statement . Schumer represents New York , site of the World Trade Center and home to many of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks , survivors and families of victims . The law , known as JASTA , passed the House and Senate without objections earlier this year . Support was fueled by impatience in Congress with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record , promotion of a severe form of Islam tied to militancy and failure to do more to ease the international refugee crisis . The law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil , clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government . Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001 . Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals . Family members had tied their last push for the bill to the 15th anniversary of the attacks this month , demonstrating outside the White House and Capitol . On Wednesday , two fire trucks displayed a giant U.S. flag outside the Senate . “ We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks , ” Terry Strada , whose husband died in the attacks , said in a statement . Obama argued that JASTA could expose U.S. companies , troops and officials to lawsuits if other countries passed reciprocal legislation , and may anger important allies . He called Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and wrote a letter to him explaining that he strongly believed enacting JASTA into law would be detrimental to U.S. interests . Reid became the only senator to side with Obama . Some lawmakers said the White House , which has a history of poor relations with Congress , had waited too long to fight the bill . The Sept. 11 families have received more than $ 7 billion , but bill backers said their intention was to allow lawsuits to punish any government that backs terrorism on U.S. soil . “ This bill was carefully negotiated over more than six years , ” Representative Jerrold Nadler , another New York Democrat , told the House . The issue , however , may not be finished . At least 28 senators signed a letter to JASTA ’ s sponsors , Schumer and Republican Senator John Cornyn , asking that they work with them to mitigate any potential unintended national security and foreign policy consequences . The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the legislation . U.S. corporations including General Electric Co and Dow Chemical Co also opposed it , as did the European Union and other U.S. allies . Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and General Joseph Dunford , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , opposed the bill and CIA Director John Brennan said JASTA had “ grave implications ” for national security . Democratic Senator Tim Kaine , Hillary Clinton ’ s vice presidential running mate , and Bernie Sanders , an independent and former Democratic White House contender , did not vote . Override opponents in the House included Representative Mac Thornberry , Republican chairman of the Armed Services committee , and Adam Smith , its ranking Democrat , citing concern about U.S. forces overseas .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S . Senator Chuck Grassley , head of the Senate Judiciary Committee , proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government , a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it . The proposed legislation , called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act , would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law , the Republican senator said in a statement . Manafort , a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trump ’ s campaign manager in 2016 , and his business associate Rick Gates , pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine ’ s former pro-Russian government . The current law , known as FARA , requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client . Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients . “ Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy , but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities , ” Grassley said in a statement . The proposed law would clarify who is required to register , improve investigative tools , including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges , and create new reporting requirements . FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists , according to the Department of Justice . As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote .',\n",
       " '- A Michigan state appeals court on Tuesday ordered a halt to the recount of that state ’ s presidential election vote sought by Green Party candidate Jill Stein , while a federal appeals court ordered the process to proceed . The conflicting rulings had both sides claiming victory but left unclear on Tuesday evening where Stein ’ s bid to recount the vote in Michigan stood . The Green Party candidate , who received only about 1 percent of the presidential vote on Nov. 8 , sued in federal court in Pennsylvania on Monday to try to force a statewide recount of U.S. presidential votes there . Stein also pushed for a recount that is under way in Wisconsin , which with Michigan and Pennsylvania , was key to Republican President-elect Donald Trump ’ s victory . “ Today , Trump and his GOP allies in Michigan tried everything in the book to stop the recount , and they failed . This recount is continuing in spite of their efforts to suppress the vote , ” said Matthew Brinckerhoff , a lawyer for the Stein campaign . Brinckerhoff was referring to a ruling by the 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that the recount should continue in Michigan . The 6th Circuit ’ s decision came within hours of an order by the state Michigan Court of Appeals that the recount be halted , on the grounds that Stein was “ not an aggrieved candidate ” with standing to demand one . “ I ’ m grateful , and I know Michigan taxpayers agree , that the Michigan Court of Appeals has adhered to the rule of law , and clarity in our Michigan statute in agreeing that Jill Stein is not an aggrieved candidate and the recall must stop , ” the state ’ s Republican attorney general , Bill Schuette , said in a written statement . Stein ’ s moves are unlikely to change the outcome of the election but she has maintained they are necessary to ensure the integrity of voting systems . Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin defied their recent history of supporting Democratic presidential candidates and handed Trump narrow wins that ultimately gave him victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton . Clinton ’ s campaign has said it would take part in the recounts .',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump may meet next week at an Asian economic summit amid strains over sanctions against Moscow , the Syria conflict and the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign . The Kremlin on Friday said talks were under way to set up an encounter at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Danang , Vietnam , from Nov. 8-10 . Trump told Fox News in an interview late on Thursday that it was possible he would meet with Putin during the trip . We may have a meeting with Putin , he said . And , again Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea . They can help us with Syria . We have to talk about Ukraine . Representatives for the White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday . It ( the meeting ) is indeed being discussed , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters . It s hard to overestimate the importance and significance for all international matters of any contact between the presidents of Russia and the United States . Putin and Trump first met at a G20 summit in Hamburg in July when they discussed allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election last year but agreed to focus on better ties rather than litigating the past . But relations between Moscow and Washington have soured further since then . Trump in August grudgingly signed off on new sanctions against Russia , a move Moscow said ended hopes for better ties . Putin ordered Washington to cut its embassy and consular staff in Russia by more than half . Tensions have also flared over the conflict in Syria . If it the Trump-Putin meeting comes about , it would come as investigations in Washington over alleged Russian meddling in the presidential election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign yielded its first indictments . U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller s office this week unveiled charges against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , Manafort associate Richard Gates and campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos . Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty while Papadapoulos pleaded guilty . The Wall Street Journal also has reported that U.S. authorities have enough evidence to charge six members of the Russian government in the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 campaign .',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW - Allegations that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election in favour of Donald Trump amount to a witch-hunt , the Kremlin said on Monday , in its first reaction to the release of a U.S. intelligence report on the alleged Russian operation . The report , a redacted version of which was released publicly last week , alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a cyber campaign aimed at helping Trump beat his rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said no new evidence had been produced to show that Russian officials was involved . “ We are observing a serious fatigue with these accusations , ” Peskov told reporters on a conference call . “ It truly is reminiscent of a witch-hunt. ” His words echoed a phrase used by Trump himself , who was quoted as saying in an interview with the New York Times newspaper on Friday that the storm over Russian hacking was a “ political witch hunt. ” Peskov , commenting on the U.S. intelligence report , said : “ You know , that version of the report that was made public added no substance whatsoever that we can comment on. ” “ Groundless accusations which are not supported by anything are being rehearsed in an amateurish , unprofessional way . We don ’ t know what information they are actually relying on. ” Asked if Putin himself had read a translation of the report , Peskov said there was nothing in the document “ that ’ s worth reading in detail. ” But Peskov said the Kremlin ’ s position , as in the past , is that it categorically rules out that any Russian official could have been involved in hacking related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election . Both Trump and Putin have said that they want to restore U.S.-Russian relations , and the Kremlin spokesman indicated that Moscow was looking beyond the hacking row and ahead to the new administration . Peskov said there had been witch-hunts in the past in U.S. history , but those periods came to an end when what he described as more sober leaders took charge . Peskov said that once Trump had been inaugurated on Jan. 20 , work would begin on finding a date for a first meeting between the Russian and U.S. leaders . “ If some kind of contacts will be planned , then they will be planned extremely painstakingly , carefully , especially since we are talking about contacts following a very tense period in our relations , ” he said , referring to disputes between the Kremlin and the Obama administration .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Incoming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell , chosen by U.S. President Donald Trump to keep the recovery humming , appears set to let an expected trillion=dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered . Powell in statements throughout the year , culminating with his recent Senate confirmation hearing , has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the Fed to raise rates faster than expected , and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs . New data added evidence to that view on Friday . Employment in November grew faster than expected , but wage growth remained muted . The share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady , six-year recovery that is approaching its pre-crisis peak . Even with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent , “ there ’ s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market , ” Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee , saying that the Fed should raise rates only gradually . Debate among Powell ’ s colleagues , meanwhile , has highlighted other risks if the Fed speeds its pace of rate increases . Some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak . Others have noted that if the Fed continues raising short-term rates while long-term rates remain stalled , it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down , a typical signal of recession . “ If the Fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn ’ t materialize , and they take rates too far , then markets would feel aggrieved , ” said Carl Tannenbaum , chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago , and a former senior risk official at the Fed Board . Other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when Powell takes over in February , the tax cuts could kick in , and the Fed stands aside . With a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework , Powell will lead “ a more data-driven Fed , which at the current juncture means a more dovish Fed , ” until and if inflation recovers , said Robin Brooks , chief economist at the Institute of International Finance . He expects the Fed under Powell to only raise rates twice next year . Policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the Republican tax plan when they meet next week . They are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year . They will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond , the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear . Top Republicans from the House and the Senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law . Though Janet Yellen remains Fed chair until February , her final scheduled press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop Powell inherits . The 64-year-old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor , and help shape the statement issued that day by the Federal Open Market Committee . It is a group struggling with a fundamental issue . The economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment , a condition in which prices and wages should be rising . Yet both remain weak . Into that mix , the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households . If there is still “ slack ” in the economy , that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase , and more workers are hired . However , if the economy is near or above its potential , as some measures indicate , it may merely cause faster-than-desired price increases , or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble . As the tax plan advanced in Congress , forecasting shops at Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of Fed rate increases - essentially expecting the Fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome . The tax package is “ ultimately worth almost two additional Fed hikes ” in coming years , Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Alec Phillips wrote in a recent analysis . But the new chair ’ s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the Fed ’ s go-slow approach can continue , giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007-2009 crisis without creating other economic risks . “ Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth ; rather , it helped restore full employment , ” Powell said in June in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top Fed job . His outlook is consistent with positions Trump and current chair Janet Yellen have taken , and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the Fed ’ s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan . At his confirmation hearing , Powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation , telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain . But when asked about Fed staff research that challenged a key Republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs , Powell kept his distance . “ It ’ s just someone ’ s research , ” Powell told senators . “ Don ’ t associate that with a position of the board . ”',\n",
       " 'ETTADAMEN , ( TUNISIA ) - A suspected Islamist militant wounded two policemen with a knife near the parliament in Tunis on Wednesday and was later arrested , Tunisia s Interior Ministry said . It was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015 . The assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be tyrants , the statement said . One of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck , while the other was only lightly wounded , it said . I saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman . He put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman , a witness told Reuters . He shouted Allahu Akbar ( God is greatest ) as he attacked the policemen . The Interior Ministry said Wednesday s suspect had confessed that he had adopted Takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad . Takfiri thought refers to a view that Muslims should proclaim other Muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them . Large numbers of police were deployed to the Bardo square in the aftermath of the attack , a witness said . Blood could be seen on the ground in the square . The square is opposite the parliament building and close to the Bardo museum , where 21 people , mostly European tourists , were killed in an attack by three gunmen in March 2015 . A security source told the attacker was 25 and from Ettadamen - one of the largest , poorest suburbs of Tunis . I know him well , he is the youngest in a family of six brothers including a sister who works in the parliament s administration , Hamid one of the attacker s neighbors told Reuters . Colonel Major Khelifa Chibani of Tunisia s national guard named the attacker as Zied Gharbi . Security forces raided his house and confiscated his personal computer and other items , he said . Sofian Sliti , a spokesman for judicial counter-terrorism investigations said that the attacker planned to join terrorist groups in Libya . As well as the Bardo killings , Tunisia suffered two other major attacks in 2015 , one against tourists at the beach resort of Sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital . The 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy , which has a large tourism sector at its Mediterranean beaches . Since then , security has been boosted at strategic sites while authorities have cracked down on militants , dismantling dozens of cells . Tunisia was the only Arab country where a long-serving leader was toppled in the region s 2011 uprisings without triggering civil war or large-scale violence . Tunisian democracy activists who kept dialogue open between Islamists and secularists were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 .',\n",

       " 'One of the most embarrassing moments in politics this week happened in Missouri.During a debate in the Missouri House Committee on Children and Families , GOP state Rep. Mike Moon declared that since he was once an embryo that means he is a qualified reproductive health expert who knows what he is talking about when it comes to abortion and whether or not an embryo is a person.And yes , people laughed at him.The hearing was about House Joint Resolution 98 , which would ban abortion in the state by enshrining the right to life of unborn human children at every stage of biological development in the Missouri Constitution.According to the Columbia Missourian , Moon opened the hearing by showing a video of an unborn fetus on a display monitor . The fetus was developed enough to make out undeniably human characteristics , such as hands and a face . A precious sight , I think most of us would agree , Moon declared . The more you look at that , the more you have to realize that that is a human being . Moon went on to compare abortion to slavery before making more of an ass of himself by concluding , As a former embryo myself , I would like protection for all embryos . After the laughter died down , a real health expert testified against the resolution.St , Louis physician Ed Weisbart said there is no scientific consensus for when life begins and that women should have the final choice to end their pregnancy or not.Meanwhile , the United States Constitution , which supersedes state law , says plainly in the 14th Amendment that only all persons born are granted citizenship under the jurisdiction of the United States.In other words , the Constitution does not consider unborn fetuses as persons under the law.Plus , banning abortion would take away the fundamental rights of due process and equal protection from women , which is unconstitutional.Not only would the Supreme Court be duty-bound to overturn HJR 98 , it would cost Missouri taxpayers millions of dollars to fund a losing cause.And if Missouri conservatives really want to continue to argue , they should consider that even their Bible does not consider fetuses to be persons.Also , being an embryo at one time does not make anyone an expert on reproductive issues . It s like saying you re an expert pastry chef because you once made mud pies as a child . That just doesn t fly.The bottom line is that women should have the choice and Republicans need to back off and stop trying to force their religious beliefs down their throats , especially when those beliefs contradict what their Bibles actually say . But the Bible shouldn t matter anyway because the Constitution has already clearly defined personhood and it starts at birth.Featured Image : Imgur',\n",

       " 'Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been essentially blacklisted in the NFL for daring to kneel during the national anthem in order to protest police brutality against people of color . He was the original player to # takeaknee , and has paid dearly for it . However , since Donald Trump has seen fit to attack anyone daring to protest in this way , the tide on the anthem protests has taken on new life . After Trump s original attacks , players throughout the league were taking knees last Sunday . The attacks continued from Trump this week , and players continued to defy Trump . Perhaps most notably , those on Kaepernick s old team.The 49ers had an entire row of players kneeling during the anthem , right in front of those who chose to stand . However , despite choosing to stand , those players had their hands on the shoulders of those kneeling in solidarity . Trump might continue to petulantly tweet at these people who are using their public platform to shine a light on the very serious and deadly issue of police brutality , but clearly things are not going in the way he had hoped.Then again , Trump seems to think that everyone is as tone deaf and racist as he and his mouthbreathing , flag-soaked base are . That is clearly not the case , though . Newsflash , you orange fascist the world is much less tolerant of bigotry than you might like to think .

       " 'MOSCOW - Russia on Tuesday unveiled a statue of Mikhail Kalashnikov , inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle that became by some estimates the most lethal weapon ever made and the best known Russian brand abroad . Perched atop a pedestal in a tiny square on Moscow s busy Garden Ring thoroughfare , the statue of Kalashnikov , who died in 2013 , has him dressed in a bomber jacket and clutching an AK-47 in both hands . I created a weapon for the defense of my fatherland , runs a Kalashnikov quote hewn on the pedestal . At the unveiling ceremony , a Kremlin guard of honor stood to attention as Russia s national anthem played . This weapon is Russia s defense . It s one of Russia s symbols . Alas , for life to continue , for lovely children to grow up , for beautiful women in Russia , there must be a weapon , the monument s sculptor , Salavat Shcherbakov , told reporters . The AK-47 , the small-arms mainstay of Russia s armed forces for over 60 years , is also featured on the national emblems of several African nations and on that of East Timor . Every fifth firearm in the world is a Kalashnikov and more than 70 million of the assault rifles have been produced over the past 60 years , the Kalashnikov concern said on its website . Kalashnikovs are in service in 50 foreign armies , it said . Military experts say the AK-47 has killed more people than all other types of modern weapons taken together . Kalashnikov , who died aged 94 , had repeatedly said that pride in his invention was mixed with the pain of seeing it used by criminals and child soldiers . As well as being embraced by armies , anti-Western revolutionary movements and leftist leaders worldwide , the relatively cheap and sturdy rifle has been used by gangsters , drug traffickers , militants and rebels of all stripes . The offspring of a large peasant family , Mikhail Kalashnikov started working on a new automatic firearm for the Soviet Red Army after he was wounded during World War Two . He won a state competition to select a new weapon , beating the Soviet Union s best designers of weapons , and it brought him the Stalin Prize . His first assault rifle was produced in 1947 and there have been numerous modifications since then . The Kalashnikov rifle is a true cultural brand of Russia , Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said at the ceremony . The unveiling of the monument was timed to coincide with Armsmakers Day marked in Russia on Tuesday . Underscoring the importance of the military-industrial complex for Russia s economy , President Vladimir Putin sent best wishes to the workers of the sector .',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump s refusal to release his tax returns has been an issue that has dogged him for his entire campaign . While it is not legally required for presidential candidates to release those documents , it has been tradition for them to do so in the interest of transparency for the electorate . However , Trump refuses . He uses being audited as an excuse , but that makes no sense since all of the returns from previous years are not being audited , and , even if they were , that would not prevent him from releasing them . Trump isn t releasing his taxes because there is something in there that he doesn t want us all to see . It s as simple as that.Well , GOP Rep.

King says of the matter : I just think the window for that has passed . When he said that he wouldn t release his returns till the audit was over , and he d been being audited for 13 years , I d say that for him to release them is just a forgone conclusion . Donald Trump will not release his tax returns . King added : If he drops it now , into this presidential intense sprint around to the final turn part of the race , I think that would be the only discussion we would hear all the way until November .

       " 'TEGUCIGALPA - The result of Honduras presidential election remained in limbo on Tuesday , with a gregarious TV host s surprise lead narrowing sharply , prompting him to call on supporters to take to the streets of the capital to defend the vote . President Juan Orlando Hernandez , who won U.S. praise for helping tackle the flow of migrants and deporting drug cartel leaders , was favored to win before Sunday s vote in the poor Central American nation with one of the world s highest murder rates . But a delayed , partial count on Monday morning pointed toward an unexpected victory for TV entertainer Salvador Nasralla , 64 . Inexplicably , election authorities then stopped giving results for more than 24 hours . When , under mounting criticism from international election monitors over a lack of transparency , the electoral tribunal began updating its website again , the tendency rapidly began to change . In a television interview on Tuesday evening , an angry Nasralla said the election was being stolen from him and asked his supporters to flock to the capital , Tegucigalpa , to protest . We ve already won the election , he said . I m not going to tolerate this , and as there are no reliable institutions in Honduras to defend us , tomorrow the Honduran people need to defend the vote on the streets . The Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States ( EOM/OAS ) in Honduras urged people to remain calm and wait for official results , which it said should be delivered as quickly and transparently as possible . The credibility of the electoral authorities and the legitimacy of the future president depend on this , it said in a statement . On Tuesday evening , Nasralla s original five-point lead had thinned to under 2 percentage points , with nearly 71 percent of ballots counted , according to the election tribunal . Nasralla said in a later television interview that the election tribunal was only counting ballots from regions where Hernandez had won , skewing the results and giving the false sense that the president was heading for victory . He asked the tribunal to include ballots from regions where he was stronger . A self-described centrist , Nasralla headed a center-left coalition called the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship , and claimed victory on Monday - as did Hernandez . Election official Marcos Ramiro Lobo told on Monday afternoon that Nasralla was leading by a margin of five points , with about 70 percent of ballots counted . Lobo said Nasralla appeared certain to win , signaling that experts at the electoral body regarded his lead as irreversible . On Tuesday , Hernandez reiterated that he had won , and refused to concede , telling supporters they should wait for final results . After Hernandez spoke , thousands of his blue-clad supporters gathered outside the presidential residence to celebrate his supposed victory . We won the election with Juan Orlando Hernandez , and we won t let them remove him from power , said 35-year-old housewife Maria Aguirre , who hailed from a rough neighborhood on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa . The election tribunal s delay was due to difficult negotiations between Hernandez s National Party and Nasralla s alliance , according to two European diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity . Behind closed doors , the parties were discussing immunity from prosecution for current officials and how to carve up positions in government , the diplomats said . In an interview on Tuesday , Nasralla denied he was in talks with the National Party . He vowed to review whether to keep a base stationed with U.S. troops if he wins the election , but also promised to deepen security co-operation . Hernandez s National Party appears set to retain control of Congress in the election , giving it the second-most important perch in the country . The European Union s chief observer for the election , Marisa Matias , urged election officials to maintain an open channel of communication as they finalized the results . The electoral body had been so certain Hernandez would win that it showed unprecedented transparency during the contest , one of the diplomats said . That left the body with little room to maneuver when Nasralla came from nowhere to take a strong lead . With a booming voice and finely coiffed hair , Nasralla is one of the country s best known faces as the host of game shows that feature scantily clad women by his side . He is backed by former President Manuel Zelaya , who was ousted in 2009 after he proposed a referendum on his re-election . The possible return to a position of influence for one-time leftist Zelaya risks fuelling concern in Washington . The United States has longstanding military ties to Honduras and few ideological allies among the current crop of Central American presidents . Hernandez , 49 , was credited with lowering the murder rate and boosting the economy , but he was also hurt by accusations of ties to illicit , drug-related financing that he denies . His bid for a second term , which was made possible by a 2015 Supreme Court decision on term limits , divided opinion in the coffee-exporting nation of 9 million people .',\n",
       " 'As you re probably aware already , Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor , yet another Bill Bill O Reilly along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino , reviewed the video . At the tail end of the segment , O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino , [ B ] y making Hillary Clinton the focus , and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby , Monica Lewinsky . O Reilly continued , You know , I don t know if Hitler made it , but you know , he might have . It s crazy . So , yes , Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler . Frankly , I don t quite know how to feel about this . On one had , O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand , O Reilly isn t totally wrong . Obviously , there s only one Hitler , and I ve resisted the urge to go there , but the ad is classic propaganda , the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign . Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels , Hitler s minister of propaganda . But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again , if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial , I m all for it . If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads , and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly , thanking him for the easy win , they re insane . This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November . Thanks , O Reilly.Via Media Matters : Featured image via Twitter',\n",
       " 'Climate grifter Al Gore is confronted about global warming and sea levels in this classic video where he just can t explain himself . One of the challenges is taking what the scientists say and believing Al GoreOUR LATEST ON AL GORE : NASA S NEW CLIMATE DATA Exposes Al Gore s Lies : The Timing of his New Movie Couldn t be More InconvenientAl Gore has become very wealthy from his invention of global warming and the creation of An Inconvenient Truth , a documentary which has been included in the science curricula of schools throughout the United States . However , the more real climate data we see , the more obvious the hoax becomes.This data couldn t come at a worse time for Al Gore , as his sequel to An Inconvenient Truth , released on July 28 , got panned by critics.A.V . Club called An Inconvenient Truth Less a movie than a glorified PowerPoint presentation .A new study from NASA confirms sea levels are falling not rising.iceagenow.info reports : NASA satellite sea level observations for the past 24 years show that on average sea levels have been rising 3.4 millimeters per year . That s 0.134 inches , about the thickness of a dime and a nickel stacked together , per year . As I said , that s the average . But when you focus in on 2016 and 2017 , you get a different picture.Sea levels fell in 2016 , and with all of this winter s record-breaking snowfall , I wouldn t be surprised if they decline again this year.I clicked and zoomed on the above chart as NASA suggested , and obtained a close-up screen shot of sea levels from Jan 2016 to March 2017 . This clearly shows the decline.Al Gore has falsely predicted that sea levels would rise by 20 feet , with some of the world s largest cities underwater.World Tribune reports : Although the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) only predicts a sea level rise of 59cm ( 17 inches ) by 2100 , Al Gore in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth went much further , talking of 20 feet , and showing computer graphics of cities such as Shanghai and San Francisco half under water , Booker noted . We all know the graphic showing central London in similar plight . As for tiny island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu , as Prince Charles likes to tell us and the Archbishop of Canterbury was again parroting last week , they are due to vanish . All of the talk about the sea rising is nothing but a colossal scare story , Booker said , citing Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Morner , formerly chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change , who for 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe . Despite fluctuations down as well as up , the sea is not rising , Morner says . It hasn t risen in 50 years . If there is any rise this century it will not be more than 10cm ( four inches ) , with an uncertainty of plus or minus 10cm . And quite apart from examining the hard evidence , he says , the elementary laws of physics ( latent heat needed to melt ice ) tell us that the apocalypse conjured up by Al Gore and Co. could not possibly come about .

       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied a report from NBC News that he told his national security advisers in July he wanted to increase the country ’ s nuclear arsenal by nearly tenfold , saying he argued for its modernization . NBC News said the president called for the increase after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s . Trump said he wanted to have that same number now , NBC reported . Speaking to reporters at the White House during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , Trump said the report was not true . “ I never discussed increasing it . I want it in perfect shape . That was just fake news by NBC , ” he said . “ We don ’ t need an increase . But I want modernization and I want total rehabilitation . It ’ s got to be in tip-top shape. ” The president ’ s denial was buttressed by a statement from his defense chief . “ Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false . This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible , ” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said . Although U.S. presidents have modernized weapon stockpiles over the years , any meaningful addition to the nuclear arsenal would violate treaty agreements . The Federation of American Scientists says the United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile . After the meeting in July , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “ moron , ” according to NBC . U.S. news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense . The NBC report comes during a time of high tension between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang ’ s nuclear weapons and missile programs , and just ahead of an expected announcement from Trump on whether to decertify the international deal on Iran ’ s nuclear program . Trump told in February that he wanted to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was at the “ top of the pack. ” MSNBC reported in 2016 that as a candidate , Trump asked a foreign policy adviser three times in a one-hour meeting why the United States could not deploy its nuclear weapons .',\n",

       " 'Remember back in May when Donald Trump said he d make California , New York and Maryland compatible ( and that he d win them ) ? Well it s now mid-October and he can barely hang on to red states Utah , Georgia , Arizona and even Texas the latest poll out of the Lone Star state has him leading by three points . Romney won Texas by 19 points in 2012.There is one state in particular that is leaning towards Hillary Clinton Arizona.The Grand Canyon state , home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio , Jan Brewer , and the god-awful SB 1070 , should be a dead set win for Trump , whose anti-immigration rhetoric has propelled him to where he is today . However , recent polling out of the state suggests that Clinton has the upper hand , and for good reason.According to a new Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll released just before the third presidential debate , Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by five points , 39-34 percent . Gary Johnson took six percent while Jill Stein took one percent . Twenty percent remain undecided.However , when pressed on how those who lean one way or the other would solidly vote , as of right now , both Clinton and Trump expand their lead : When including leaners in the sample , the number of undecideds drops to 8.1 percent . Clinton s support rises to 43.3 percent while Trump s support increases to 37.8 percent . Johnson gets 6.5 percent while Stein gets 4.3 percent . The margin of error for the sample including the leaners is plus or minus 4 percentage points.In Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight general election projection , Clinton has a 58 percent chance of winning Arizona s 11 electoral votes , compared to Trump s 42 percent chance . In the last 48 polls conducted in the state , Clinton holds the edge in 26 , Trump in 19 , and a tie in three.It is because of these shocking poll results that the Clinton campaign is pumping more than $ 2 million in advertising in the state and sending a slew of high profile surrogates including First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders all across the state.The last time Arizona went blue was in 1996 , when voters chose Bill Clinton over Senator Bob Dole by 2 percent.Imagine if Arizona , a state most affected by illegal immigration , stuck it to Trump on election day ? Arizona is proving to have a rich , culturally diverse electorate , buoyed by Latino and Hispanic voters who don t take too kindly to Trump s xenophobic , racist tones.Ana Navarro was right if Trump thought insulting Mexicans and Hispanics was the right move , he s going to have one hell of a wake up call in November.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'PAINTSVILLE , Kentucky - President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating funding for economic development programs supporting laid-off coal miners and others in Appalachia , stirring fears in a region that supported him of another letdown on the heels of the coal industry ’ s collapse . The 2018 budget proposal submitted to Congress by the White House on Thursday would cut funds to the Appalachian Regional Commission ( ARC ) and the U.S. Economic Development Administration . The Washington-based organizations are charged with diversifying the economies of states like West Virginia and Kentucky to help them recover from coal ’ s decline . The proposed cuts would save the federal government $ 340 million and come as the Republican president seeks to slash a wide array of federal programs and regulations to make way for increased military spending . But they are perceived by some in Appalachia as a betrayal of his promises to help coal miners . “ Folks that live in Appalachia believe that the ARC belongs to them , ” said federal ARC Co-Chair Earl Gohl , bemoaning the proposed cut . “ It ’ s really their organization. ” Republican Congressman Hal Rogers , who represents eastern Kentucky ’ s coal counties , said he would fight to restore the funding when Congress negotiates the budget later this year . “ It ’ s true that the president won his election in rural country . I would really like to see him climb aboard the ARC vehicle as a way to help us help ourselves , ” Rogers said . Four hundred of the 420 counties ARC operates in voted for Trump in November ’ s election . The 52-year old agency has run more than 650 projects in Appalachia ’ s 13 states between 2011 and 2015 costing hundreds of millions of dollars . Its programs , some launched under Democratic former President Barack Obama , are expected to create or retain more than 23,670 jobs and train and educate over 49,000 students and workers , the organization said . Trump vowed during his campaign that the White House would put American coal miners back to work , in part by cutting environmental regulations ushered in by Obama , mainly aimed at curbing climate change but characterized by Trump as hampering the industry . However , many industry experts and coal miners doubt that rolling back regulation alone can revive the coal mining industry , which faces stiff competition from abundant and cheap natural gas in fueling U.S. power generation . Rigel Preston , a 38-year old former surface miner , said ARC programs helped him land a job as a paid intern at technology company Interapt after he lost his benefits . He said that , while he and many members of his family in eastern Kentucky hope Trump will deliver on his promise to revive the coal industry , he believed the region ’ s future lay elsewhere . “ From my experience from the coalfield , I know that that is a finite job and coal will run out eventually , ” Preston said . Preston was among several former miners and other east Kentuckians at an event in Paintsville this week held by Interapt and ARC to announce Interapt ’ s plan to hire another hundred people from the region this summer . Interapt last year launched a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky , supported by ARC , which provides 36 weeks of paid training in code and paid internships . Interapt Chief Executive Ankur Gopal , a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur , expanded his Louisville-based company out to eastern Kentucky with the vision of lifting that part of his home state out of economic stagnation . “ There is a skilled workforce and opportunity that can be found here in eastern Kentucky , ” Gopal said . “ This is not just a bunch of people that are waiting for coal mines to reopen. ” ARC has worked on economic development in Appalachia since its founding in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson ’ s “ war on poverty. ” In recent years it has focused on helping states in the region deal with the coal industry ’ s sharp decline and the loss of 33,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2016 . So far , ARC has had no official contact from the president ’ s transition teams , said co-chair Gohl , an Obama appointee who remains in the job . The cuts to its funding were recommended to the administration by the Heritage Foundation , a Washington-based think tank . Nick Loris , an energy fellow at the foundation , said the work that ARC and the Economic Development Administration do should be devolved to state and local governments “ to encourage transparency and reduce duplicative federal spending. ” States have said their budgets are already strapped . In addition to all of West Virginia and part of Kentucky , the ARC covers parts of Alabama , Georgia , Maryland , Mississippi , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia .',\n",
       " 'Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to arrange Pentagon and State Department consulting contracts for her daughter s friend , prompting concerns of federal ethics rules violations.Clinton in 2009 arranged meetings between Jacqueline Newmyer Deal , a friend of Chelsea Clinton and head of the defense consulting group Long Term Strategy Group , with Pentagon officials that involved contracting discussions , according to emails from Clinton s private server made public recently by the State Department . Clinton also tried to help Deal win a contract for consulting work with the State Department s director of policy planning , according to the emails.Deal is a close friend of Chelsea Clinton , who is vice chair of the Clinton Foundation . Emails between the two were included among the thousands recovered from a private email server used by the secretary of state between 2009 and 2013 . Chelsea Clinton has described Deal as her best friend . Both Clintons attended Deal s 2011 wedding.Here s a little blurb from the fashion rag WWD on an event the two attended together : This story first appeared in the October 20 , 2011 issue of WWD . Wearing a short-skirted black Chanel dress , Clinton began by crediting her longtime friend Jacqueline Newmyer . Jackie invited me to see Romeo and Juliet , she said , remembering back to 1995 . The next time , I got my parents to come . And I have been coming here ever since . That historic family night out occurred three years later . She and her parents arrived at the theater two days after Christmas 1998 and a week after the House of Representatives voted to impeach her father . The show they saw ? None other than Twelfth Night , a tale of magical transformation . Talk about Freudian.Later , at the after party , Clinton elaborated on the nearly 20-year friendship with Newmyer , putting to lie the old Harry Truman quip If you want a friend in Washington , get a dog . Jackie and I are still best friends , said Clinton , who met Newmyer her first year in Washington at the Sidwell Friends School . She was in my wedding , and I was in hers . Clinton , 31 , continues to work on snagging her Oxford Ph.D. while working at New York University and with the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative . Newmyer , 32 , is the president of the Long Term Strategy Group , a military research firm in Cambridge , Mass.Government cronyism , or the use of senior positions to help family friends , is not illegal . However , the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality , or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest.Specifically , the Code of Federal Ethics states that government employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual . Pentagon ethics guidelines also call for avoiding actions that would create even the appearance of improper behavior or conflicts of interest.The Clinton email exchanges with Deal between 2009 and 2011 were among tens of thousands of private emails made public by the State Department under pressure from Congress and the public interest law firm Judicial Watch.Read more : WFB',\n",
       " '( Corrects Sept. 21 story to remove reference to constitutional crisis if poll not held within 60 days , paragraph 15 ) By George Obulutsa and John Ndiso NAIROBI - Kenya s President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Thursday the country s Supreme Court staged a coup against the will of the people when it annulled his win in last month s presidential election , his toughest rhetoric yet in the wake of the Aug. 8 vote . His remarks came on the same day that the election board announced the repeat election had been delayed until Oct. 26 . The president s criticism comes as Kenya s political temperature is heating up , reviving fears of political violence . Clashes killed around 1,200 people following a disputed 2007 presidential vote . A coup in Kenya has just been done by the four people in the Supreme Court , Kenyatta said in a televised meeting with supporters , delivered mostly in Kiswahili . ( The court is saying ) numbers don t matter , it is processes that matter . Immediately following the court s surprise Sept. 1 ruling to annul the vote , Kenyatta had called for calm and respect for the ruling . But he later started to criticize the court . The decision to nullify the race on procedural grounds was the first time a judicial body canceled the election of an incumbent African president . Kenya , a Western ally , has East Africa s richest economy and is a hub for diplomacy , security and trade in a region often battered by conflict . Any sign of political instability sends ripples through the region . The election board had said last month that Kenyatta won the Aug. 8 vote by 1.4 million more votes than his chief rival , veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga , who contested the result in court . Four judges and two dissenting judges gave a detailed case for voiding the election or upholding it in a marathon 12-hour court session on Wednesday . Kenyatta said in a televised news conference that the court had failed to adequately examine evidence that would have buttressed his win . The Supreme Court owes Kenyans an explanation how such a monstrous injustice took place , he said . It ( the ruling ) also now has the potential to throw our country into judicial chaos . He said lower courts could follow the precedent and overturn the will of voters in other electoral contests , like local or legislative seats , adding he had asked parliament to address the issues raised by the judgment . On Thursday , the cabinet approved 10 billion shillings ( $ 97 million ) to fund the repeat election . Odinga has said he will not take part in the repeat vote unless a list of demands , including firing of some senior staff at the election board , are met . The court said it had found no evidence of individual culpability by the staff of the board . The court ruled that the country must hold the election by the end of October . The court s detailed judgment given on Wednesday hinged on the failure of the election board to check electronic tallies , which are vulnerable to typos , against paper forms intended as a fail-safe backup before announcing results . Judges did not say they found evidence of rigging . Kenyatta said he would respect the court s decision but said it subverted the will of the people . We have reversed everything in this country by the decision of a few people . I don t know how history will judge these gentlemen , he said . The citizen has been told he does not have a voice ... If that is not dictatorship , then I don t know what to say .',\n",
       " 'A few weeks ago , we reported on the first female Muslim legislator , Ilhan Omar , the 34-year-old Democrat community organizer who came to America as a refugee from Somalia . Ilhan was one of only two state legislators who voted to prevent Life Insurance companies from denying benefits to benefactors of terrorists who died committing an act of terror against Americans.Omar is also a vocal opponent of President Trump ( see video here ) and his plan to better vet refugees coming from nations that are terror hotbeds . It s not unrealistic that the largest Somali Muslim population in America will also become a hotbed for terror.On November 19 , 2016 U.S. District Judge Michael Davis sent a clear message to America : There is a terrorist cell in Minneapolis and it is still alive today . In sentencing nine young Somali-Minnesotans on terror conspiracy charges this week , U.S. District Judge Michael Davis closed a chapter in the federal government s long , extraordinary investigation of ISIL recruitment in Minnesota.But the full story is far from over.Each day , Davis sought to extract acknowledgment from the young men that they were terrorists , and left no doubt as to his thoughts on whether they were simply misguided youths . Everyone talks about Brussels or Paris having cells , Davis said one day , then , raising his voice : We have a cell here in Minneapolis . Saying the Minnesota public had danced around the issue , Davis described the cell s size as being between nine to 20 , including those sentenced last week and others killed abroad . Star TribuneRefugee expert Ann Corcoran who owns the amazing Refugee Resettlement Watch website explores why Somali refugees are fleeing states like Arizona where they are being delivered by our government and heading for Minnesota ? Corcoran asks : Why would they leave a climate more like home to move to the frigid north in droves ? All sorts of reasons are given in this article from the Phoenix New Times -supposedly for jobs , to be with family members , Somali community , better welfare , but not mentioned is to build political power through numbers . Minnesota will be the first state to push for aspects of Shariah Law to be put in place , in my opinion.Bilad Yusuf and her seven kids were on their way to Minnesota , less than two months after they arrived in Phoenix . We didn t know how to get jobs here , and even if we did , we didn t know how we d get to them , she explained through an interpreter who translated from Somali to English.After waiting for six years in a refugee camp , Yusuf and her family arrived in the United States this winter amidst the chaos surrounding the Trump administration s attempt to block Somali immigrants like them from entering the country.Following a brief stop in Houston , they were transferred to Phoenix . There , stranded in the urban sprawl without a car , they found themselves lost : Where were they supposed to get groceries ? How did they go about setting up long-overdue doctor s appointments ? How would they pay rent after their initial stipend from the U.S. government ran out ? The Somali Association of Arizona stepped in , providing groceries and setting up doctor s appointments for the refugees . But they couldn t do anything about the fact that the fact that with limited English and no training , Yusuf and her older children weren t qualified for many jobs.So , worried that her rent would be cut off soon , Yusuf ultimately decided they should move to Minnesota , where she , like virtually all Somalis , has family.Mukhtar Sheikh , the program coordinator for the Somali Association of Arizona , says that Yusuf s story is a common one.Between 1981 and 2017 , Arizona took in 7,351 Somali refugees , according to Department of Economic Security statistics . But how many of those refugees actually stay in the state is another question.Sheikh estimates that as many as half the Somali refugees resettled in Arizona end up leaving typically for Minnesota , or other parts of the country where there s a large Somali community because they re unable to find jobs here . I think Arizona is able to do more for refugees , to be honest , he says . If Arizona invested in these families , it would actually benefit the state , because they re really hardworking . Contrary to popular belief , refugees who are resettled in Arizona receive relatively little financial assistance from the state . In fact , their main source of cash assistance is the federal government.But the biggest challenge is finding a job , he says . When he first arrived in Phoenix , he was able to find a job at Sky Harbor International Airport and work his way through ASU . Other Somalis have followed a similar path and found jobs at the airport . But many others have found that even jobs cleaning hotel rooms or washing dishes in a restaurant come with a requirement that applicants speak English or , unofficially , Spanish . The people that struggle the most are people who have no educational background , Sheikh says . They re the people most in need , and they face the biggest hardships when coming here and trying to find opportunities here . Recently , he s gotten calls from recruiters working on behalf of Amazon warehouses in Minnesota and Kentucky , looking to hire managers who speak Somali in addition to English.Should American companies be actively recruiting non-English speaking , uneducated refugees for jobs in America ? Why are the airports one of the first places newly transplanted refugees coming from terror hotbed nations are finding employment ? Shouldn t we fix our broken welfare system instead of recruiting workers from overseas to do the jobs Americans won t do ? That tells him that they re hiring a lot of Somali refugees who don t speak English yet , he says . He d like to see the same thing happen in Arizona , where , to his knowledge , only a handful of refugees have been able to get jobs at Amazon distribution centers.But , he acknowledges , There s only only so much that one company can do . There has to be support from the state . The Department of Economic Security , which administers the Arizona Refugee Resettlement program , doesn t track where refugees end up once they stop receiving services from the state , director of communications Tasya Peterson says.So it s impossible to get an exact count of how many refugees have left for other states in search of better opportunities.But , Peterson adds : We do know that Somali refugees resettled in many states have relocated to live in cities in which the largest numbers of Somalis reside , including cities in Minnesota and Ohio , due to mutual assistance and other affinity relationships . Phoenix New TimesFor residents of Minneapolis however , many are facing a new reality with the exploding Somali refugee population . In July 2015 , we reported on a mob of 30 young Somali men who raged through an upscale neighborhood , yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood , obviously shaken in a TV interview , related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her . They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you , one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV . It was a very traumatizing experience . Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims , and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood , which is filled with million-dollar homes.Here is the shocking and disturbing video taken by the homeowner who reported the incident .

Thuc is one of two officials that Vietnamese state media had earlier this month reported would be prosecuted . Vietnam s state-run news agency later apologized for issuing what it said was a false report on the prosecution of the two . Thuc was not available for comment . PetroVietnam did not immediately respond to a request for comment . PetroVietnam is at the center of a high-level corruption crackdown . Former PetroVietnam chairman and also a former member of the communist state s politburo , Dinh La Thang , 56 , was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal . Police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at PetroVietnam that resulted in an 800 billion dong ( $ 35 million ) loss for local lender Ocean Bank . On Tuesday , the security ministry said Phan Dinh Duc , a member of PetroVietnam s board of directors , would face prosecution over financial losses . The corruption crackdown made global headlines in August when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh , a former chairman of PetroVietnam s construction unit , after he applied for asylum in Berlin . Vietnam has denied kidnapping Thanh and has said he turned himself in . The Communist Party has said Thanh will go on trial in January .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - With a bitter election campaign finally over , the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing . As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration , Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year , when they will have control of Congress and the White House . Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary “ continuing resolution ” on the budget . It expires on Dec. 9 . Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then . Mired in partisan gridlock , Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process , falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months . During their “ lame-duck ” session starting this week , lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations . Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday . A new Congress will meet in January , with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last week ’ s elections . Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber . The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives , though it is slightly smaller , giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans . Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session .

Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March , which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit , according to House aides . Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February , giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year , which ends on Sept. 30 . Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans , Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas .',\n",
       " 'President Obama couldn t be more different from his successor , Donald Trump . Obama has so much class and grace . As for Trump , well , not so much . Their responses to the death of Fidel Castro say so much about who these men , and their supporters by default , really are . And the differences between them are abundantly clear.Obama responded with respect and compassion . His carefully crafted words are just one more example of the quiet dignity we have come to expect from this man and his family . Here is what the president had to say on Castro s passing : At this time of Fidel Castro s passing , we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people . We know that this moment fills Cubans in Cuba and in the United States with powerful emotions , recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives , families , and of the Cuban nation . History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.For nearly six decades , the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements . During my presidency , we have worked hard to put the past behind us , pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends bonds of family , culture , commerce , and common humanity . This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans , who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.Today , we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family , and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people . In the days ahead , they will recall the past and also look to the future . As they do , the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.Trump s response had none of the elegance that President Obama is so well known for . Naturally , Trump started off with a tweet.Fidel Castro is dead ! Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 26 , 2016After Trump was slammed for his four-word response , he released a statement that was every bit as crass and hateful as you would expect from a bombastic billionaire who built his campaign on fear and bigotry.Today , the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades . Fidel Castro s legacy is one of firing squads , theft , unimaginable suffering , poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.While Cuba remains a totalitarian island , it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long , and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.Though the tragedies , deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro can not be erased , our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty . I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign , including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me , with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.Trump s statement , when compared to President Obama s response really does say it all , doesn t it ? We are in for a very long four years . Here s to hoping the 2020 election comes before the four horsemen.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images and Scott Olson/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'PARIS - President Francois Hollande on Thursday fired back at comments by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that “ France was no longer France ” after a slew of militant attacks , saying France would always stay true to its values . France is reeling from two strikes in under two weeks by attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State , the first when a Tunisian plowed his truck through a crowd in Nice , the second when two men slit the throat of a priest . “ France is no longer France . They won ’ t like me for saying that , ” Trump told reporters in Miami on Wednesday . “ And this world better be very careful and the better get very tough and they ’ ll never do it with ( Democratic nominee ) Hillary Clinton. ” Trump ’ s campaign has been marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric . He has called for tougher surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were “ trying to take over our children. ” Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist . Brushing off Trump ’ s words , Hollande on Thursday told reporters France would always remain true to its values and ideals . “ When you stoop low you ’ re not true to yourself anymore , that ’ s something that can happen to others on the other side of the Atlantic , ” Hollande said , without directly mentioning Trump .',\n",

       " 'Hillary Clinton always putting a radical ideology and her own personal financial gain before the best interests of America . Is this really the kind of leader America needs after 8 miserable , lawless years of Barack Obama ? Under two terms of a President Hillary Clinton , the U.S. Muslim population would exceed Germany s current Muslim population , according to data from Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security.According to a Pew report published earlier this week , as of 2010 , there were 4.8 million Muslims in Germany . In September , 2015 , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that the United States should accept 65,000 refugees from Syria to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the war there . We re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more , the former secretary of state said Sunday on CBS Face the Nation . I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in . Via : CBS NewsHere s Trump on the out-of-control refugee crisis and common sense ideas on how he thinks America should deal with it : A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3.3 million Muslims living in the United States . This means that today the U.S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait , or Brunei , or Bahrain , or Djibouti , or Qatar . Under current policy , Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040 . However , under a President Hillary Clinton it s possible that date could come much sooner.Under two terms of a Hillary Clinton presidency , the U.S. would have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.Based on the most recent DHS data available , the U.S. permanently resettled roughly 149,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014.Yet , as Donald Trump explained during Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention , Clinton has called for a radical 550 % increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama . Specifically , Clinton had said that , as president , she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year . Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.As Trump explained , Clinton s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U.S. already admits from Muslim countries.Adding Clinton s 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year , means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President . If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency , she could potentially resettle roughly 1.5 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms.These projections suggest that after seven years of a Hillary Clinton Presidency , the U.S. could have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.These projections are rough estimates , and the population size could be impacted by additional various factors including births , deaths , and conversions .

       " 'The world is now reporting zero cases of ebola , the deadly virus that killed thousands in Africa . That good news comes after a sustained global relief effort led by President Obama and the American military , scientists and relief workers.President Obama marked the occasion in a Twitter post , pointing out that the moment is a Great example of what we can achieve when we lead . Before I start , wanted to share this . Liberia is now Ebola-free . Great example of what we can achieve when we lead . pic.twitter.com/qjVcwg8tIi President Obama ( @ POTUS ) January 14 , 2016From the World Health Organization report cited by the President : No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) were reported in the week to 3 January . On 29 December , WHO declared that human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus has ended in Guinea , after the completion of 42 days with zero cases since the last person confirmed to have EVD received a second consecutive negative blood test for Ebola virus RNA . Guinea has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance . Guinea , Liberia , and Sierra Leone have all now succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission linked to the original outbreak in West Africa.Yet Obama had to swim against the tide of right-wing scaremongering and media sensationalism in order to accomplish this vital task.In September 2014 , Obama deployed 3,000 American troops to West Africa to help with efforts there to fight the spread of the disease . He also appointed an Ebola czar to coordinate the response , along with existing leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and other elements of the U.S. government.As Obama did this , the right was in the middle of hysterics . They were calling for the borders to be shut down , Chris Christie was unnecessarily quarantining a nurse , and Fox News figures were seriously claiming that Obama wanted an Ebola outbreak in America . Another Fox News talking head said Obama welcomed Ebola because his affinities are with Africa.At the same time , the more mainstream press was whipping itself into a frenzy , devoting hours and hours to what should be done if there was an Ebola outbreak in America despite the hundreds of safeguards in place from medical professionals . CNN hyped the non-problem more than even MSNBC and Fox.Curiously , this mainstream Ebola hype consisted of about 1,000 segments in the four weeks before the 2014 midterm elections , when Republicans were often campaigning on Ebola hype against Democrats , then fell off after the GOP increased its Congressional seats . Convenient.Still , President Obama refused to give into the fear and frankly hysterically overwrought madness embraced by the right and the media . As a result , a killer outbreak is in full retreat . Ebola hasn t been eradicated , but in all likelihood this latest outbreak is over and Barack Obama stepped up to the plate and led yet another successful fight.Featured image via YouTube',\n",

Like many of his previous speeches , Trump proved that he is unable to stay focused for more than a few minutes , and he displayed his short attention span by getting completely off topic and complaining about how Democrats have supposedly obstructed him.Trump began by ignoring the fact that he s about to get rocked by his Russia scandal , as he pretended that a new era of American prosperity is about to begin , and you see it , it s already beginning . Then , as with any Trump speech , several minutes were spent bashing former President Barack Obama . Trump said : To achieve our full economic strength , we must repeal and replace Obamacare . Now it is time for the Senate , Mitch McConnell working very hard to act and save Americans from this catastrophic event , because Obamacare is dead . Obamacare was one of the biggest broken promises in the history of politics . Clearly , Trump is choosing not to recognize the fact that Trumpcare , more formally known as the American Health Care Act , failed miserably while Americans still overwhelmingly prefer Obamacare . In fact , it was Trump s own disastrous health care plan that helped more Americans than ever voice their appreciation for Obamacare ! Trump then completely derailed to blast Democrats for not supporting him and being obstructionists as he turned his infrastructure speech into a pity party of one : That s why I am calling on all the Democrats , who honestly have really been obstructionists . Boy , have they tried . Every single thing . On healthcare , I won t get one vote on health care , Obamacare is crashing , it s dead , it is in a death spiral as the head of one of the biggest insurance companies said , it is in a death spiral .

       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating Republican Representative Blake Farenthold over allegations of sexual harassment , discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member . The panel said in a statement it was also looking into whether the Corpus Christi , Texas , congressman made inappropriate statements to other members of his official staff . Farenthold , 55 , said in a statement he was relieved that the ethics panel was going to look into the allegations . “ Once all the facts are released , I ’ m confident this matter will once and for all be settled and resolved , ” he said . Politico reported last week that the U.S. Congress ’ Office of Compliance had paid $ 84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold for a sexual harassment claim . In 2014 , Farenthold ’ s former communications director Lauren Greene sued him , alleging a hostile work environment , gender discrimination and retaliation , court documents showed . Farenthold and Greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation , but the settlement ’ s details were confidential , according to a statement released at the time , where Farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing . Farenthold told KRIS-TV in Corpus Christi on Monday that he would return the sum . Capitol Hill has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations of sexual misconduct by lawmakers , and outrage that public money may have been paid to settle harassment suits against members of Congress .

       " 'It doesn t matter how loudly Fox News protests , the fact is that there s an epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses all over America . Compounding and enabling the problem is the phenomenal resistance college administrations have to actually dealing with it . The preferred method is to intimidate the victim into silence and sweep the whole thing under the rug.But the Don t Accept Rape campaign has a much different idea : A print ad appearing in Harvard University s student newspaper on Saturday has a controversial message for students : The trauma of trying to get school administrators to take sexual assault seriously is becoming a routine part of the collegiate experience.The ad buy is timed to coincide with the school s accepted students weekend , when many high school seniors who are considering attending Harvard in the fall visit the campus . Styled like an acceptance letter that lets a prospective student know they ve been admitted , the ad makes the case that sexual assault may be one of the college memories in store for them.I imagine that Harvard s administration is none to happy about it but tough shit . If they d put more effort into treating rape victims like actual victims instead of potential embarrassments , this genius ad wouldn t be necessary : The Don t Accept Rape website also has several clever , if highly depressing , videos showing both male and female students reading their college acceptance letters explaining how they ll be sexually assaulted and then ignored or witness a rape and be pressured to keep quiet about it . I ve always been mystified by the impulse of colleges to cover up rapes on their campuses . I would think that making a huge stink about it and having law enforcement prosecute to the fullest extent of the law would be a selling point , not a potential public relations negative.But what do I know ?

       " 'WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and aides to his successor , Condoleezza Rice , both received classified information a handful of times via personal email accounts , the top Democrat on a congressional oversight panel said on Thursday . The findings come after nearly a year of controversy over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s decision to set up a private email server for her work as secretary of state . Democratic lawmakers and staff on Clinton ’ s presidential campaign seized on the report as vindicating some of their defenses of the controversial arrangement . Representative Elijah Cummings said the disclosures about Powell ’ s and Rice ’ s aides ’ emails were made by the State Department ’ s inspector general , who is reviewing the email practices of the last five secretaries of state . That office told the State Department on Wednesday that it found 12 emails containing classified information sent to Rice ’ s aides or Powell , according to Cummings , who is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee . In a statement , Powell said the two emails he received were not judged to contain confidential information at the time they were sent to him by American ambassadors . “ I wish they would release them , ” Powell told NBC News , “ so that a normal , air-breathing mammal would look at them and say , ‘ What ’ s the issue ? ’ ” A representative for Rice , who , as with Powell , served under Republican President George W. Bush , said the 10 emails sent to her aides did not contain intelligence information . More than 1,500 of Clinton ’ s emails , which are being made public on a federal judge ’ s order , have been found to include classified information so far , according to the State Department . Clinton both sent and received information the State Department now deems to be classified , including the privately shared thoughts of foreign leaders , as well as highly classified U.S. intelligence agency secrets . It became public last March that Clinton set up a private email server in her New York home for her work as President Barack Obama ’ s secretary of state between 2009 and 2013 . Accusations that she exposed government secrets to hackers and tried to side-step record keeping laws have since dogged her campaign , and the arrangement is being examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Clinton ’ s campaign staff suggested the findings announced on Thursday helped vindicate her claim that she did nothing wrong or unusual and repeated their accusation that the State Department is overclassifying her emails , an idea the department has dismissed . “ Hillary Clinton agrees with her predecessor that his emails , like hers , are being inappropriately subjected to over-classification , ” John Podesta , Clinton ’ s campaign chairman , said in a statement , calling for their unredacted release . J. William Leonard , who oversaw the government ’ s classification regime as the Information Security Oversight Office director until 2008 , said so-called “ spillage ” of classified information into unsecured email systems was common . “ That ’ s why from the get-go it was exceedingly poor judgment to set up a private email account because of this very real fact , ” Leonard said in an interview , referring to Clinton ’ s arrangement . The government forbids sending classified information via email , but the .gov email system , which Clinton circumvented , is monitored and protected on the assumption that classified information spills into it . Powell has said the State Department was technologically backward when he joined in 2001 and that he had to fight to get an Internet-connected computer installed in his office , from which he continued to use his personal email account . Georgia Godfrey , Rice ’ s chief of staff at Stanford University ’ s Hoover Institution , said Rice did not use email while at the State Department , and that the 10 emails to her staff were reports on “ diplomatic conversations. ” Government regulations require that information shared in confidence by foreign government officials should be treated as classified .',\n",
       " 'DHAKA - Bangladesh lodged a protest after it said Myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries , government officials said on Wednesday , amid growing tensions over the huge influx of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar . An army crackdown triggered by an attack on Aug. 25 by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces has led to the killing of at least 400 people and the exodus of nearly 125,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh , leading to a major humanitarian crisis . When asked whether Bangladesh had lodged the complaint , Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque said yes without elaborating . Three other government sources confirmed that a protest note was faxed to Myanmar in the morning saying the Buddhist-majority country was violating international norms . Bangladesh has expressed great concern to Myanmar about the explosions very close to the border , a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters . The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter . A Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them . But none had been planted recently . Two Bangladeshi sources told they believed Myanmar security forces were putting the landmines in their territory along the barbed-wire fence between a series of border pillars . Both sources said Bangladesh learned about the landmines mainly through photographic evidence and informers . Our forces have also seen three to four groups working near the barbed wire fence , putting something into the ground , one of the sources said . We then confirmed with our informers that they were laying land mines . The sources did not clarify if the groups were in uniform , but added that they were sure they were not Rohingya insurgents . Manzurul Hassan Khan , a Bangladesh border guard officer , told earlier that two blasts were heard on Tuesday on the Myanmar side , after two on Monday fueled speculation that Myanmar forces had laid land mines . One boy had his left leg blown off on Tuesday near a border crossing before being brought to Bangladesh for treatment , while another boy suffered minor injuries , Khan said , adding that the blast could have been a mine explosion . A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast on Monday - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in a no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine : a metal disc about 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) in diameter partially buried in the mud . He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground . Two refugees also told they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the Monday blasts , which occurred around 2:25 p.m. was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were land mines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army . The Myanmar army has not commented on the blasts near the border . Zaw Htay , the spokesman for Myanmar s national leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , was not immediately available for comment . On Monday , he told clarification was needed to determine where did it explode , who can go there and who laid those land mines . Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists ? The Bangladesh interior ministry secretary , Mostafa Kamal Uddin , did not respond to calls seeking comment . The border pillars mentioned by the Dhaka-based sources mark the boundaries of the two countries , along which Myanmar has a portion of barbed wire fencing . Most of the two countries 217-km-long border is porous . They are not doing anything on Bangladeshi soil , said one of the sources . But we have not seen such laying of land mines in the border before . Myanmar , which was under military rule until recently and is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world , is one of the few countries that have not signed the 1997 U.N . Mine Ban Treaty .',\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON The clock began running out this week on a strategy that has provided U.S. Republicans in Congress with their only notable legislative successes this year : aggressive use of an obscure U.S. law known as the Congressional Review Act ( CRA ) . On his 75th day in power , President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors , but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy . Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an “ avalanche of red tape ” from the administration of President Barack Obama , a Democrat . REUTERS COMMENTARYWar College : One tank to rule them allThe right way to address the Marines United Facebook GroupIn legal battles against travel ban , Trump 's own statements are his worst enemy Since Trump took office on Jan. 20 , McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations , most of concern to business interests . Trump has signed 11 of these into law , not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing “ substantially similar ” regulations in the future . White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is “ vastly different ” from past presidents in rolling back regulations . On Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections . He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers , change public school assessments , and reduce coal waste runoff into streams . Last Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obama ’ s administration . Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May . Democrats assail the reversals as harming the environment , education and checks on Wall Street , with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists . Representative Louise Slaughter , the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes , said in an interview “ of course it benefits the lobbyists. ” But she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore . “ Partly I think it ’ s because they don ’ t have anything else to do , ” she said about Republicans ’ eagerness . “ Other than that I think it ’ s just another ‘ take that Obama. ’ ” McCarthy , a Californian and the No . 2 House Republican , saw the CRA ’ s potential before the election . Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017 , the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy . But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon , if the stars aligned . Under the law , resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the president ’ s signature . So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work . The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions : 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized , meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office . The stars aligned on Nov. 8 , when Republicans captured the White House , Senate and House . For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans . The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30 . Right after the election , McCarthy told his party to “ go through each regulation on our priority list , ” he said . “ If you look at Article One of the Constitution , this isn ’ t the role of these agencies . The agencies have become too big , ” McCarthy said in an interview with Reuters . The first resolutions sailed through , primarily because Republicans had opposed the regulations long before they were finalized . McCarthy said so many lawmakers objected to the stream pollution rule that wiping it off the books was easy . Even though the CRA effort is winding down , McCarthy ’ s brief campaign showed that aggressive use of the law could succeed , and provided Republicans with some modest , but needed successes in a time when they are struggling with larger matters . “ After years of talk about cutting red tape , it is now actually happening , ” House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday . “ We are reversing the Obama administration ’ s most recent and last regulatory onslaught . ”\",\n",

       " 'NEW YORK - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ’ s scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether EPA chief Scott Pruitt violated the agency ’ s policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change , according to an email seen by on Friday . Lawyers for environmental group the Sierra Club had asked the EPA ’ s Office of Inspector General to check whether Pruitt violated policy when he told a CNBC interviewer on March 9 , “ I would not agree that it ’ s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. ” The EPA Inspector General ’ s office responded to the Sierra Club on Thursday in an email , saying it had referred the matter to the EPA ’ s Scientific Integrity Officer , Francesca Grifo , for review . “ If after the SIO review , she concludes there is some aspect of the letter itself , or her findings or conclusions that she believes are appropriate for further consideration by the OIG , she will so notify the OIG , ” the email stated . A spokeswoman for the EPA defended Pruitt ’ s comments . “ Administrator Pruitt makes no apologies for having a candid dialogue about climate science and commonsense regulations that will protect our environment , without creating unnecessary regulatory burdens that kill jobs , ” said Liz Bowman in an emailed statement . “ Differing views and opinions on scientific and technical matters is a legitimate and necessary part of EPA ’ s decision-making process , which is consistent with EPA ’ s scientific integrity policy that was in place even during the Obama administration , ” she added . The EPA website says its scientific integrity policy requires EPA officials and staff to ensure the agency ’ s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community . An overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a major contributor to global climate change , triggering sea level rise , droughts and more frequent violent storms . The request by Sierra Club ramps up tension between the U.S. environmental movement and the administration of President Donald Trump , who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the U.S. economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change . Grifo is a biologist who was hired by former President Barack Obama ’ s administration . Before she joined the EPA in late 2013 , she oversaw scientific integrity at the Union of Concerned Scientists , a non-partisan group advocating stronger environmental protections . Pruitt , a former attorney general for Oklahoma , sued the EPA more than a dozen times over its regulations as top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state .',\n",
       " 'BRIGHTON , England - Britain s opposition Labour Party set out plans on Monday to nationalize billions of pounds of privately-funded infrastructure contracts , cap credit card interest charges , and get extra cash from large corporations . It said it would offer shareholder compensation for the contract nationalization . In June s election , Labour found more support than expected among voters seeking change after seven-years of Conservative-led government , coming in second . Although no election is due until 2022 , it is preparing for Theresa May s Conservative minority government to fall much sooner . Under socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn , a parliamentary veteran , and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell , Labour has shifted from the centrist pro-business platform of former prime minister Tony Blair to a more interventionist left-wing pitch . McDonnell used a speech at the party s annual conference in the English seaside resort of Brighton to call for a more state-controlled economy , promising to bring so-called Private Finance Initiative contracts into public control . The contracts have been used for decades to fund public infrastructure project using private capital . They have long attracted criticism for inflating costs and channeling public money to shareholders . Successive governments have attempted to reform the process . We ll put an end to this scandal and we ll reduce the cost to the taxpayers ... we ll bring existing PFI contracts back in-house , McDonnell said . A 2015 parliamentary report said the government owed over 222 billion pounds of charges on PFI contracts spread across several decades . Labour said shareholders would be compensated in the form of government bonds at a level determined by when the contracts are brought back into public control . They did not give an estimated cost for the policy . McDonnell also repeated pledges from Labour s popular 2017 election manifesto to nationalize industries like rail and water . Business was critical of the approach . The Shadow Chancellor s vision of massive state intervention is the wrong plan at the wrong time . It raises a warning flag over the British economy at a critical time for our country s future , said Carolyn Fairbairn , director-general of the CBI business lobby group . Labour has struggled in recent years to overcome the perception that it is to blame for the effects of 2007/8 financial crisis , which led to a recession , costly bank bailouts and a sharp rise in the national debt . But McDonnell criticized the Conservatives economic track record since they took power from Labour in 2010 and said they were responsible for slow wage growth which was forcing consumers into debt and risking another economic crisis . He said Labour wanted the financial regulator to impose a cap on the amount of interest payable on credit card debt to help those caught in persistent debt . It means that no-one will ever pay more in interest than their original loan , McDonnell said . If the Tories refuse to act , I can announce today that the next Labour Government will amend the law . The Financial Conduct Authority in April proposed a set of less-radical measures to encourage companies to reduce the number of customers in persistent debt . The finance industry trade body said the FCA had rejected the idea of an outright cap on interest charges . And the government said Labour proposals went too far and would hurt the economy . McDonnell , who once listed generally fomenting the overthrow of capitalism among his interests in the Who s Who directory of influential people , also took aim at the wealthy , bankers and large corporations . He said Labour would fund its plans for higher public spending on things like health and education and a large-scale infrastructure investment program by clamping down on tax evasion and making big firms pay more tax . To pay for those public services we ll close the tax loopholes and the tax avoidance scams ( used ) by the mega rich , he said . He criticized the banking system for pumping up property prices and fuelling a rentier economy , pledging instead to make sure banks invest in high value , high productivity businesses . To reconnect the financial sector to the economy of research and development and production , we will transform our financial system , he said .',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says Reframing the current diplomatic crisis in North Korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situation.Former US President Jimmy Carter is suggesting just that . But will the hawks in Washington listen ? . The Carter CenterThe harsh rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries , and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the United States and North Korea . In addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric , our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries , especially China and Russia . The recent UN Security Council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help . In all cases , a nuclear exchange must be avoided . All parties must assure North Koreans they we will forego any military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.President Jimmy CarterI have visited North Korea three times , and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect U.S.-DPRK relations.In June 1994 , I met with Kim Il Sung in a time of crisis , when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and to seek mutual agreement with the United States on a permanent peace treaty , to have summit talks with the president of South Korea , to expedite the recovery of the remains of American service personnel buried in his country , and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula . Kim Il Sung died shortly after my visit , and his successor , Kim Jong Il , notified me and leaders in Washington that he would honor the promises made by his father . These obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in Geneva by Robert Gallucci and other representatives of the Clinton administration.I returned to Pyongyang in August 2010 , at the invitation of North Korean leaders , to bring home Aijalon Gomes , an American who had been detained there . My last visit to North Korea was in May 2011 when I led a delegation of Elders ( former presidents of Ireland and Finland and former prime minister of Norway ) to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy people.During all these visits , the North Koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the United States and their neighbors , but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country . They wanted a peace treaty ( especially with America ) to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the Korean War in 1953 , and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period . They have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of Seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any American attack . The influence of China in Pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since Kim Jong Un became the North Korean leader in December 2011.A commitment to peace by the United States and North Korea is crucial.When this confrontational crisis is ended , the United States should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953 . The United States should make this clear , to North Koreans and to our allies.READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions equated the opioid epidemic to a personal failing by many Americans who can not “ say no ” to drugs on Thursday , and he said that marijuana could be serving as a gateway to the problem . “ People should say no to drug use . They have got to protect themselves first , ” he said during a question-and-answer session at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington . Sessions made his comments ahead of President Donald Trump ’ s declaration that the opioid crisis a public health emergency , a move that will redirect federal resources to help combat the problem . Sessions said he was extremely troubled by the epidemic , saying it has led to more overdose deaths than the height of the AIDS public health crisis in the 1980s . According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015 . The Justice Department has stepped up enforcement efforts to combat the problem . Earlier on Thursday , the Justice Department announced it had secured an indictment against a Pittsburgh-based doctor for unlawfully distributing opioids , in the first case of its kind to be brought since Sessions launched an Opioid Abuse and Detection unit . But in response to a question about how best to combat the epidemic , Sessions cast the problem in a moral light . “ I do think that this whole country needs to not be so lackadaisical about drugs , ” he said . In urging people to say no to drugs , his comments channeled former First Lady Nancy Reagan , who famously launched a “ Just Say No ” anti-drug campaign when the crack cocaine epidemic was ravaging communities in the 1980s . Her husband , President Ronald Reagan , during his tenure signed into law a sweeping criminal justice bill that established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses , including marijuana . Sessions said on Thursday that “ fentanyl people are really killers , ” but did not clarify to whom he was specifically referring . He also said that he has heard from many police chiefs that drug addiction “ starts with marijuana. ” Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate that is up to 50 times more lethal than heroin . Michael Correia , the government relations director for the National Cannabis Industry Association , said Sessions is ill-informed and pointed to data showing many of the overdoses involve prescription painkillers . According to the CDC , nearly half of all the opioid overdose deaths in the United States in 2015 involved prescription medications . Correia said Sessions “ is still repeating the old , tired argument that marijuana is a gateway when there is a lot of evidence that proves otherwise . ”',\n",

       " \"If Donald Trump had been at Madison Square Garden during this Marc Anthony concert , he would have been booed out of the building.During the concert , the popular Latino singer took aim at the Republican billionaire by shouting at the top of his lungs about his pride at being a Latino before telling Trump to go f * ck himself , which drew a loud cheer from the thousands in attendance . I m proud to be a Latino , Anthony told his fans . I just want to say , we re proud of our country . We speak a little differently . We have our own food , we have our own way of being . But here , no matter where you come from , we re Latinos . And we have to take care of each other , no matter where we come from . There s only one f * cking box to check when you come to this country , and it says Latino ! ' There s some crazy movement coming from some Anthony began to say while motioning with his hands . He then wanted to say two things . First , F * ck Donald Trump ! Anthony then told the crowd that he wants Trump to hear it from his house . Wake that motherf * cker up . And then the concert resumed.Here s the video via YouTube.It s understandable why Anthony has a problem with Donald Trump . Throughout his run for the presidency , Trump has repeatedly launched unfair attacks on Latinos . During his official campaign announcement Trump characterized all Mexicans as rapists , and promised to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep Latino immigrants from entering the country . Ever since , he has blamed Latinos for the crime and violence in the United States and called for a renewal of Operation Wetback , a deportation initiative under the Eisenhower Administration , a consequence of which resulted in the use of wetback as a derogatory term against Latinos and the displacement of thousands of men , women , and children.The fact is that , like Donald Trump , Marc Anthony is an American citizen and a native New Yorker . But while Trump clings to a racist version of America , Anthony believes in the historical diversity that has made America great over countless generations.That being said , Republicans should tread carefully if they really want Latinos to vote for their candidate in November . After all , 70 percent of Latinos voted for President Obama in 2012 . If the GOP doesn t stop being racist , they can expect even more Latinos to vote against them this time around .

As expected , her recollection of Trump says otherwise.In an interview on CNN , Res told Alisyn Camerota that she was not only supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , but gave Americans a brutal lesson about why supreme sexist Trump should not be allowed anywhere near the White House . Res was brutal in her criticism , and every word she spoke was true . She held nothing back as she trashed her former boss : First of all , everyone knows he has no experience . I mean , the idea that he would be president is just ridiculous . I have other developers I worked for who were just as smart or smarter than he was , and I wouldn t vote for them for president , either . Res argued that all presidential candidates before Trump have at least some grasp of how government and the world works , as well as some experience under their belt . Res says this is the exact opposite of what has happened with Trump : The way he shows himself , he doesn t seem to know basic civics . Then , she drops a major truth bomb on voters , telling them the terrifying things she s learned about Trump while working for him . She said : The worst thing about Trump , and the reason not to vote for him for president , is his temperament . He flies off the handle , he attacks viciously it s like shooting someone and having a nuclear bomb come back at you . He s vindictive , and he s dishonest.He always was dishonest , all the time I worked with him .

Res addressed the leaked audio tape where Trump made lewd comments about sexually assaulting women and told Olivia Nuzzi of The Daily Beast : I had never heard him say p * ssy before . I heard him say f * ck a million times . The way he said it I just grab it I was shocked at that , and then you know , when I took the time to put it into context , I said , yeah , that s right .

And he told me , and he believed this , that women had to work harder and be smarter and were willing to work harder than men , and that s what he wanted , and he had a couple of women working for him Men are better than women , he said , but a good woman is better than 10 men .

Could this be a sign that Trump considering former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani for his Secretary of Homeland Security ? LifeZette has confirmed that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump will travel to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto.Sources , that include Mexican officials involved in the planning of the visit , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , stated the meeting would cover a broad variety of topics ranging from trade to security to immigration and the contentious issue of border enforcement.It is expected that Trump advisor and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , along with high-ranking Mexican officials , will attend the meeting.The meeting will occur , despite concerns from both Mexican security services and the U.S. Secret Service.Officials expect the two leaders to make some statement following the meeting , but do not expect a full press conference.The trip is particularly historic for Trump in that no previous non-incumbent presidential nominee of a major party has ever travelled to Mexico as part of his campaign.The stakes for both Donald Trump and the Mexican president are high.For Nieto , the meeting represents a tremendous opportunity to offer Trump , the potential next President of the United States , an olive branch . Nieto has made negative comments about Trump in the past , including a suggestion Trump was like a fascist dictator . The meeting will offer Nieto the chance to clear the deck with the potential next leader of a nation on which his own is almost entirely economically reliant and earn goodwill for himself and his country among Trump supporters.For Trump , the historic meeting comes at a time when the GOP nominee is ramping up a high-stakes bid to win over support from traditionally Democratic minority voters in the United States . Republican presidential nominees usually aren t bold enough to go into communities of color and take the case right to them , and compete for all ears and compete for all votes , Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said in an August 28 interview with ABC , They ve been afraid to do that . So , Mr. Trump deserves credit for at least taking the case directly to the people . Trump surrogate Dr. Ben Carson laid out the key objectives Trump is pursuing in his outreach to minority communities . He wants to find out from a lot of different sources what people perceive the problems to be and what they perceive the solutions to be , Carson said in an interview with Michel Martin on NPR . He also wants to hear about things that have effectively moved people out of the position of dependency and put them on a ladder to success . Tying the ecomic message geared towards minority voters into the campaign s overall theme Carson said , you can not be great if you have large pockets of people who are failing .

He was talking with his girlfriend on the phone when a group of white officers shouted at him to drop the gun , then immediately opened fire , shooting him multiple times in the back.His last words were It s not real . The judge ruled that Ritchie can not be charged with inciting violence , including panic , involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide , all charges that the court was asked to consider.Ritchie can face charges of making a false alarm , however a crime for which he could serve six months in jail and pay fines of up to $ 1000 .

       " 'WASHINGTON - A secret meeting at a neighbor ’ s house , a drive through a back country road , and a clandestine flight on a military jet marked Judge Neil Gorsuch ’ s journey to the White House this week after U.S. President Donald Trump chose him as his Supreme Court nominee . Trump , who took office on January 20 , called Gorsuch on Monday to inform him that he had prevailed among a handful of finalists to succeed deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the high court . That decision set off a rapid and secretive process to get Gorsuch to Washington without alerting journalists and other Supreme Court watchers of the president ’ s selection . After Trump called the Colorado-based judge , a team from the White House counsel ’ s office flew to Denver and then drove to Boulder , roughly 45 minutes away , to meet with Gorsuch and his family . They met at a neighbor ’ s house to avoid detection . Then the White House staff spirited him though a “ back farm road ” to a waiting military plane to transport him to Washington , White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday night in the White House East Room . Gorsuch stayed at a friend ’ s residence before being brought to the White House for the Tuesday evening announcement . The secrecy continued up until the last minute . When Trump , a former reality television star , entered the East Room , he came alone , addressing the cameras and the waiting crowd , which included Scalia ’ s widow , at a podium before calling on Gorsuch and his wife to come in . Trump ’ s decision came after he narrowed a list of 21 candidates down to six , including Thomas Hardiman , William Pryor , Amul Thapar , Diane Sykes , and Don Willett . Then President-elect Trump interviewed Gorsuch , Hardiman and Pryor on Jan. 14 in his New York residence . He also interviewed Thapar . “ He finalized the decision recently , ” after considering all 21 candidates “ very deeply , ” said Kellyanne Conway , a senior adviser and counselor to the president . White House counsel Don McGahn informed Hardiman , Pryor and Thapar that they had not been chosen , Spicer said . The White House was determined to keep the president ’ s Supreme Court selection a secret and make the announcement of his choice a success after the botched rollout of his refugee executive order contributed to confusion and worldwide criticism last weekend . The strategy to get Gorsuch confirmed will kick off right away , Spicer said , with former Senator Kelly Ayotte serving as the “ sherpa ” to help steer the nominee through the Senate confirmation process .',\n",
       " 'LOWELLVILLE , Ohio - On a sweltering evening in a rural corner of Ohio , the struggle for the soul and identity of the Democratic Party is playing out over wine , meatballs and recriminations about Hillary Clinton ’ s defeat in last year ’ s presidential election . Joe Schiavoni , the former top Democrat in the Ohio state senate , is talking to a crowd at a fundraising event for his fledgling bid to become their next governor . He believes leaders of his party in Washington have lost touch with voters . It ’ s a familiar refrain among Democrats in a state that helped catapult Republican Donald Trump into the White House in November . “ You can ’ t just talk about things and send out press releases , ” says Schiavoni , a former boxer who revels in his blue collar roots . Many in the crowd , a few miles from the Rust Belt city of Youngstown , nod in vigorous agreement . Meeting voters and hearing their daily concerns is vital , he says . In Ohio , as in other politically competitive “ swing ” states that Democrats won in 2012 but lost in 2016 , Democrats are struggling to come up with a clear message and identity to win back the voters they lost . Listening to voters is the key to moving forward , some three dozen Democratic Party members across Ohio said in interviews . But there was little consensus on how to win over those voters . Many of those interviewed said the party ’ s national leaders have not learned the lessons of last year ’ s defeat , when many voters rejected the party as too elitist and out of touch with working Americans . David Pepper , chairman of the state party , dismissed that criticism in an interview , saying he and his team have been traveling around Ohio , talking to voters and visiting their homes . They have been especially focused on two groups : the people who voted twice for President Barack Obama and then Trump , and Democratic voters who sat out the last election . Democrats across America , as in Ohio , are desperate to win again as they look ahead to next year ’ s congressional elections . The stakes are high . Without a significant shift in voting patterns , the party will fail to recapture the House of Representatives and could lose more seats in the Senate , where they are already in the minority . On Monday , the national Democratic Party unveiled an economic platform they said would help U.S. families . Called “ A Better Deal , ” it was the first major step by the party to try to reconnect with voters since the election . The plan called for creating 10 million jobs over five years and cracking down on monopolies and big corporate mergers . “ But the plan was missing a vital piece , ” said Alan Melamed , a longstanding member of the Ohio Democratic Party ’ s executive committee and a political consultant who has worked on dozens of campaigns for more than 40 years . “ We need to show we are fighting for people . The plan failed to do that. ” Since Clinton ’ s defeat in November , Tom Perez , the head of the Democratic National Committee – the body which runs the national party – has conducted a nationwide “ listening tour ” to hear why so many traditionally Democratic voters defected to Trump last year . Yet when he came to Ohio , some Democrats said , he didn ’ t do much listening – just a lot of talking . In June , the listening tour came to Youngstown . About 75 party stalwarts paid $ 25 each to attend a “ Pizza with Perez ” event at a local pizzeria . “ What I saw was a typical campaign event , with the audience doing the listening while Democratic operatives touted their positions , ” said John Russo , the former co-director of the Center for Working Class Studies at Youngstown University and a political analyst . “ We paid $ 25 to be told by Perez what he thought we were thinking. ” Michael Tyler , a spokesman for Perez , disputed that account , saying Perez had done a lot of listening at the event . “ Too many in Ohio and elsewhere feel politically homeless because for too long the national party focused solely on electing the president of the United States at the expense of local concerns , ” Tyler said . “ That ’ s exactly why Ohio was among the first places Tom visited when he decided to run for DNC chair. ” One of the national politicians unveiling “ A Better Deal ” in the town of Berryville , Virginia at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley , was Nancy Pelosi , the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives . Mention Pelosi to Democrats in Ohio and many roll their eyes . A California liberal , Pelosi is part of the problem , not the solution , they said in interviews . They view Pelosi as part of a coastal elite that does not understand the struggles of Americans in the Midwest . Christopher Celeste , the son of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste and a major Democratic Party donor at both the state and national level , said the retention of Pelosi as a party leader earlier this year was “ mindboggling. ” Drew Hammill , a spokesman for Pelosi , said the Democratic leader has raised almost $ 570 million for Democrats since becoming part of the party leadership in 2002 , and was a master legislator and strategist . “ While some may find it politically advantageous to engage in a circular firing squad , Leader Pelosi isn ’ t in Congress on a shift . She ’ s on a mission to protect the Affordable Care Act , ” said Hammill , referring to Obama ’ s healthcare reform law which Trump wants to repeal . Joyce Beatty , a congresswoman from central Ohio , also defended Pelosi . “ To just blame Nancy Pelosi is not only wrong , but it ’ s wrong for Democrats to do it . If there has been a failure we all need to own it. ” Angered by last year ’ s defeats up and down the ballot in Ohio , a group of political consultants circulated a memo to every member of the state party ’ s executive committee in December . The memo , which has not been previously reported , lambastes the party leadership for the “ electoral carnage ” of 2016 . ( Read the memo here tmsnrt.rs/2h2sTgT ) Clinton lost Ohio , a key battleground , by over eight points . Only one Democratic presidential candidate in the past 40 years – Walter Mondale in 1984 – won fewer counties in Ohio than Clinton . Ohio Democrats also lost the U.S. Senate race , both Democratic nominees for the Ohio Supreme Court were defeated , and state races were lost . Ohio ’ s Democratic congressional delegation in Washington is at its lowest in decades and Republicans control the governor ’ s mansion and both the state House and Senate . “ The status quo can not stand , ” the memo says . It calls for “ new messages – and more effective strategies for delivering them. ” The memo does not make clear what those messages should be . A source close to the state party leadership dismissed the memo as sniping by disgruntled consultants . Pepper , the Ohio party leader , does not want to relitigate the past . “ We need to go and talk to voters and win them back , ” he said .',\n",
       " '- A Trump administration lawyer on Tuesday urged a U.S. appeals court in Manhattan to rule that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees . The U.S. Department of Justice is supporting a New York skydiving company , Altitude Express Inc , in a lawsuit brought by former instructor Donald Zarda , who accused the company of firing him after he told a customer he was gay and she complained . Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit , and his estate took over the case . Judges on the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals focused their questions on whether discrimination against gay workers is a form of unlawful sex bias under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . That law bans discrimination based on workers ’ sex , race , religion and other traits . Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan told the court that Congress never intended for that law to protect gay workers against bias . And in recent years , he said , lawmakers have repeatedly declined to pass bills that would prohibit employment discrimination against gay workers . During the Obama administration , the Justice Department had not weighed in on the case . But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , which appeared at Tuesday ’ s hearing on behalf of Zarda ’ s estate , has been arguing for five years that bias against gay workers violates the law . The EEOC is an independent federal agency that enforces Title VII . So far , only one federal appeals court , in Chicago , has agreed with the commission . Several 2nd Circuit judges questioned Mooppan about why the Justice Department got involved , and whether it first consulted with the EEOC . Mooppan said it would not be appropriate for him to discuss the department ’ s internal procedures . Lawyers for Zarda ’ s estate and the EEOC told the court gay workers are protected by Title VII because sexual orientation is necessarily linked to a person ’ s sex . LGBT groups say the case is crucial because a victory for Zarda ’ s estate would deepen a split among federal appeals courts and increase the chances that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue . Earlier this month , the high court was asked to review a ruling that dismissed a similar case by a former hospital security guard in Georgia . A three-judge 2nd Circuit panel in April had ruled against Zarda ’ s estate , citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex bias . The full court can overturn the prior decision . The case is Zarda v. Altitude Express Inc , 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , No . 15-3775 .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday the Trump administration ’ s tax reform plan will not change the deductibility of mortgage interest and charitable contributions . “ Let me first clarify , we are not taking away the charitable deduction and we are leaving the mortgage interest deduction as is , ” Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox Business Network . “ We think those are both very , very important . But what we are going to do is we are looking at other things where the reduction in deductions will offset the rate , ” he said . On Dec. 1 , prior to President Donald Trump taking office , Mnuchin told CNBC that Trump wanted to cap the amount of mortgage interest that taxpayers can deduct . The mortgage interest deduction is already capped at loans up to $ 1 million if you are married and filing income taxes jointly , and at $ 500,000 if you file separately . Trump , in a speech to Congress on Tuesday night , said he wanted to provide “ massive tax relief ” to the middle class and cut corporate tax rates , but he did not offer specifics . Mnuchin said he expects a tax reform plan to be passed by Congress and signed by the president by August . Trump has said tax reform should reduce tax rates for individuals and businesses , do away with longstanding tax loopholes and broaden the tax base in order to drive U.S. economic growth .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Vice President Mike Pence took the rare step of breaking a tie in the U.S. Senate on Thursday , casting the deciding vote to roll back protections for reproductive health funds . Using the Congressional Review Act , which allows lawmakers to repeal recently minted regulations , senators killed a rule intended to keep federal grants flowing to clinics that provide contraception and other services in states that want to block the funding . The rule was enacted in the final weeks of former President Barack Obama ’ s administration , giving lawmakers the opening to nullify it under the review law . In recent years states such as Texas have kept some healthcare providers from receiving the grants as part of the country ’ s longstanding fight over abortion . It was the second time on Thursday that Pence used his role as the chamber ’ s president to end a deadlock . He was called to the capitol earlier to carry the resolution through a procedural vote . Saying the rule usurps states ’ rights , Republicans argued local lawmakers should decide how healthcare money is distributed . Their main concern is that federal money is being used to provide abortions , although the grants are specifically barred from funding those procedures . Republicans , including President Donald Trump , generally oppose abortion . “ This regulation is an unnecessary restriction on states that know their residents ’ own needs best , ” said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . Democrats said the resolution was an attack on women ’ s health , contending the rollback will make it harder for low-income and rural women to obtain screenings for cancer and other diseases , as well as contraception . Most resolutions killing recent Obama-era regulations have sailed through the Republican-controlled Congress . They need to win only simple majorities in both chambers to go to the president for signing . The congressional review law was used only once successfully until this year . The family-planning resolution marked the 13th time it has been deployed effectively since the beginning of February , as well as the first time a resolution has come within a hair ’ s breadth of failing . “ Republicans didn ’ t listen to us , ” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington , the senior Democrat on the health committee . “ They didn ’ t listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women ’ s access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable. ” The nonprofit Planned Parenthood , which provides abortions and many other health and contraception services , receives some of the federal funding . Noting the recent collapse of the Republican healthcare bill in the U.S. House of Representatives , Dawn Laguens , executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , said Thursday ’ s votes were close because “ people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access healthcare . ”',\n",

Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the fact that , for the second year in a row , only white actors have gotten Oscar nominations is highly suspect . Rampling , however , said the following of the controversy : Maybe this time , no black actor or actress deserved to make it to the final selection . Why should we always categorize people ? I think nowadays we are living in easily offended societies . There will always be someone who s too beautiful , too black or not white enough .

Outrageous , ignorant & offensive comments from Rampling . https : //t.co/h7r1HNND5E Chelsea Clinton ( @ ChelseaClinton ) January 22 , 2016The problem here is that Rampling and those who think like her have absolutely zero understanding of systemic racism and the way it works when it comes to seeping into literally every crevice of our society and lives . Rampling , like many people suffering from white privilege , is terrified that she ll lose her throne if there s more space for others.Chelsea Clinton , however , understands just what this boycott is , and why it is so important . It should not have taken public outcry and boycotts for the Academy to change its rules regarding voting for these awards . That is what it took , though , and in 2016 , that s a damn shame.I am just eternally grateful to Chelsea Clinton for speaking out against the likes of Charlotte Rampling and others who would squash this very important conversation .

       " 'YAOUNDE - Separatists from Cameroon s Anglophone region have killed four security forces in several attacks over the past few days , the government said on Saturday , an unprecedented violent turn to a movement that risks morphing into a full blown insurgency . A government crackdown on the separatists has killed dozens of people since October and driven many into the arms of a once-fringe separatist movement ahead of presidential elections in 2018 . It followed on from demonstrations a year ago by English-speakers in the western region bordering Nigeria against what they see as a marginalization by the mostly French-speaking government of President Paul Biya , who has been in power for 35 years . Only a minority want to secede , however . The secessionists have been around for decades , but operated underground and had been largely non-violent until a few weeks ago . A spokesman for the separatists acknowledged the latest attacks but disputed details of the government account , and said five security forces had been killed . In Saturday s statement , Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma gave more details of the killing of two gendarmes reported on Tuesday and Wednesday , and said two further attacks on Thursday night had killed two soldiers . Referring to attacks earlier in the week , Tchiroma said assailants armed with machetes stormed a high school in the town of Jakiri on Tuesday . The separatists are disrupting schools that teach in French . Gendarmes arrived on the scene to stop them , but one was killed in the resultant scuffle . Tchiroma said he was executed , but Cho Ayaba , a leading member of the political wing of the separatist movement who lives abroad told in Dakar by telephone that he was killed in a firefight . Then on Wednesday , in the restive city of Bamenda , another attack left a gendarme dead , Tchiroma said . Ayaba reported two deaths of security forces in that attack . On Thursday night , insurgents killed a soldier in Bamenda by slitting his throat , Tchiroma said , and another female soldier guarding a bridge . As I speak , four members of the Defense and Security Forces on duty have been killed , murdered by terrorists on behalf of the secessionist movement , Tchiroma said . Ayaba contradicted that , saying that all of the deaths had occurred in shootouts , and that no one had their throat slit . That s absolute nonsense , he said . There was no physical contact . Cameroon s language divide is a legacy of World War One , when the League of Nations split the former German colony of Kamerun between allied French and British victors . Hundreds of Anglophone Cameroonians were swept up in mass arrests following demonstrations on Oct. 1 , and at least 5,000 have fled the crisis for neighboring Nigeria . The crackdown , which included cutting the Internet , locking up opponents and using helicopter gunships to fire on civilians , and a lack of any political solution is fast transforming a protest movement into an armed rebellion . Cameroon soldiers are enforcing an occupation , Ayaba said . The only thing that will make us stop these attacks is if the regime withdraws ... if they stop using the military to impose political exclusion and systematic terror on our people .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - The top Republican at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , known for his critical views on corporate penalties , expressed some support on Friday for imposing them in cases in which companies violate foreign bribery laws . “ I am generally comfortable with assessing civil monetary penalties in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases , ” Acting SEC Chairman Michael Piwowar said in remarks at the Practising Law Institute ’ s “ SEC Speaks ” conference . “ According to academic literature , there is evidence that when such violations are revealed to the market , the stock price does not always fall , and may even increase , ” he added . Piwowar ’ s comments come at a time when many on Wall Street have been questioning whether the Justice Department and the SEC will ease enforcement of the FCPA . Prior to being elected , President Donald Trump expressed concern about the FCPA , calling it a “ horrible law ” that should be changed . In addition , Trump ’ s pick to lead the SEC , attorney Jay Clayton , previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced . Clayton is still awaiting U.S. Senate confirmation . Piwowar ’ s comments suggest there is likely to be some support among SEC commissioners to continue pursuing foreign bribery cases , given the impact FCPA disclosures have on share prices . Piwowar is well known for being critical about how the SEC decides when to assess corporate penalties generally , amid concerns that sizeable fines against public companies may in some cases unduly punish ordinary shareholders who are already victims of the alleged wrongdoing . He previously voted against imposing penalties against JPMorgan Chase & Co over its “ London Whale ” trades . The SEC did not win authority from Congress to seek penalties until 1990 , and even then , the agency was slow to embrace the practice until after the major accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom . But in 2006 , then-SEC Chair Chris Cox shifted gears amid concerns from some SEC officials about corporate penalties and issued guidance that spells out factors the commission should consider when determining whether to levy them . Piwowar said on Friday he closely follows those guidelines . “ It is entirely appropriate to discipline and punish corporate malefactors who violate our laws , ” he said . But the SEC must “ remember the innocent investors ” who are also victims , he added .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Two-thirds of Americans voting in Tuesday ’ s presidential election favor moderate or strong gun control measures , according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll , up from 59 percent who said so in 2012 . Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been a vocal opponent of increased limits on American gun ownership , while Democrat Hillary Clinton has advocated for an assault weapons ban and comprehensive background checks on would-be gun owners , following a slew of deadly mass shootings in the United States .

The survey found that Americans ’ views on abortion – another divisive issue in American politics - has not changed significantly since 2012 , with 39 percent of voters saying it should be illegal . Trump opposes abortion and has said it should be punished while Clinton believes it should remain legal .',\n",

Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 12 , 2017Comey responded in front of the Senate by saying , Oh Lordy , I hope there are tapes . Well , Comey might be disappointed to learn that , at least according to the Secret Service , there aren t. Trump was bluffing . No surprise there.The Wall Street Journal issued a freedom of information request to the Secret Service , who said this : In response to your request , the Secret Service has conducted a reasonable search for responsive records , the agency wrote . It appears , from a review of Secret Service s main indices , that there are no records pertaining to your request that are referenced in these indices . That doesn t necessarily mean there are no tapes , but it makes it far less likely . The Secret Service is generally the department that handles Oval Office tapes . They did it for Richard Nixon and for John F. Kennedy . Trump , though , has his own personal bodyguard in the Oval Office , as well as government Secret Service.Still , it s very unlikely there is a tape . While Trump has been teasing it like it s a reality show , his staff has been evading the question.At a press conference Friday , Trump said he would reveal whether he had taped his conversations with Comey in the very near future and over a fairly short period of time . Bloomberg s Toluse Olorunnipa recently noted that Trump has often made and missed deadlines as a way of delaying or avoiding answering tough questions . Why leave open this question of whether there are tapes ? Ayesha Rascoe asked Spicer at his press briefing Monday .

A star who met a world leader , for example , might be asked for details about that meeting.The CIA has officials assigned full-time to the care and feeding of Hollywood assets , Rizzo wrote . Other former CIA officials added that some of those operatives work in the Los Angeles office of an agency department called the National Resources Division , which recruits people in the U.S. to help America spy abroad . Through the connections above , were also reminded of the alleged Orlando shooter s father , Seddique Mateen , who is closely tied to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC . Here s a passage from a recent 21WIRE report discussing a deeper intelligence connection with the Mateen family : Omar Mateen , worked as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security , then we learned that the elder Mateen is also standing to run for President of Afghanistan and is allied with the Taliban leadership an absolutely ideal profile for a Washington-managed , CIA controlled-opposition political candidate . SEE ALSO : Father of Orlando Shooter is Long-time CIA AssetWhat is the public to make of Mateen s own acting and film background as it relates to America s largest mass shooting are we again seeing a clear link between Hollywood and military/security services ? Was the Orlando shooting also a production of sorts ? The theatrical aspects of this event , as depicted in the media over the last 6 days are so pervasive and over-the-top that one might easily conclude that there is much more at play than a lone gunman and a saddened but resilient community determined to overcome this senseless and horrific tragedy . The media script seems already written before the killer is even named.Crisis Actors Agents of Change Here Peekay Truth shows a video depicting strange elements surrounding the Orlando shooting The dancing actor clip depicted above is reminiscent of the October drill said to have taken place during the Canadian Parliament shooting in 2014 , where many wondered why police and security services were seen laughing and joking supposedly in the midst of a serious tragedy . As Seen on TV : Orlando s Acting Professionals Additionally , there was a Pulse nightclub goer seen immediately making the media rounds on TV following the dramatic shooting event , one Luis Burbano , an actor/model featured in a few Hollywood films , according to his IMDB bio.Here s a YouTube clip featuring Burbano s media appearance One of the Orlando shooting survivors has admitted to locking an exit door , putting dozens of revelers lives at risk during the massacre.The revelations about Luis Burbano s actions the night of the shooting have come to light after he gave an interview , saying he regrets his second chance at life.Nearby , he saw people moving through a small employee s only door hidden behind a curtain , and followed after . On the other side of the door was a narrow hallway where Burbano estimates about 20 people were crawling over each other to get to the exit at the other end . Burbano says he decided to shut the door behind him because the hallway was getting dangerously overcrowded . Here s another out-of-town Pulse club goer , Shawn Royster Santiago , from New York City , who apparently witnessed the shooting and who also happens to have a media/acting and modeling pedigree as well.According to Santiago s ModelMayhem profile it states , [ I ve been ] modeling and performing in the entertainment industry off and on since i was 11 , having appeared in a variety of projects such as Television/Commercials , and he currently works as a Visual Merchandiser . Watch him in the news clip below shortly after the Orlando shooting attack Additionally , the YouTube video montages another interview with the professional actor and model named Luis Burbano , where he admits was blocking an exit at the time of the shooting The media linked personality , Patience Carter , from Philadelphia , PA , has also caused many to ask questions . Watch this YouTube clip from Now the Truth , to see her role in the Orlando story Here s a review of some previously covered anomalies here at 21WIRE As we previously reported , though the Orlando shooting attack was officially stated to have been carried out around 2am , The Daily Mail published Facebook posts from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline , suggesting the shooting happened much earlier.Here are the Facebook comments featured in the Daily Mail for review If these time stamps are correct and the posts have not been doctored in any way , then these posts present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of events at Pulse nightclub.Here s another clip with the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting : Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but officials have classified the rampage as a domestic terrorism incident , Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.Javer Antonetti , 53 , told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire . There were so many ( shots ) , at least 40 , he said . I saw two guys and it was constant , like pow , pow , pow , . From a logistical stand point Mateen s ability to carry out the shooting by himself seems to be another questionable aspect to an increasingly troubled case.Another club eyewitness Jon Alamo , heard 20 , 40 , 50 shots , and then The music stopped . While the stress of the incident could account for some differences , forensically it s hard to believe Mateen would have been able to have the ability to shoot over hundred people with only 50 some shots.According to multiple eyewitness accounts people inside the club mentioned that there was possibly as many as four shooters in and around the area . The witness seen in the image just below described the following : Then he [ Mateen ] called someone he knew and he mentioned that he was the fourth shooter , and there were three others . One of the main mainstream media protagonists from the Orlando Shooting event was a man named Chris Hansen , an aspiring actor and entertainer who played a central role as survivor and hero in a number of heavily rotated media clips depicting the aftermath of the event .

Fake Trauma & Staged Casualty Drills Back in March , 21WIRE also covered the suspicious Brussels airport attack , that coincidentally revealed a host of inter-agency mass casualty drills taking place on the global stage : In October of 2015 , SputnikNews reported massive NATO drills in Belgium and other member countries : On October 21 , the largest NATO military exercises in 13 years moved into an active phase testing threat response . The drills involve over 36,000 troops from 30 NATO and partner countries . The first phase of the Trident Juncture drills began October 3 , running for two weeks in Canada , Norway , Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands . The second part is taking place in southern Europe Spain , Italy , and Portugal as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean . Similarly , in February , The Daily Mail published an article reporting Europe s largest-ever disaster response training exercise : Police , firefighters and paramedics will this week work side-by-side with more than 70 partner agencies including local councils , utility companies and specialist search and rescue teams to respond to the disaster during the four-day drill.Disaster victim identification teams from all UK police regions are also working alongside other forensic specialists in a mortuary on site.Teams will also be working alongside firefighters from Italy , Hungary and Cyprus who will also be mobilised to the incident on Wednesday.Although this scenario is not a terrorist attack , we will be practising procedures and systems that are common to any emergency that results in a large number of fatalities and injuries .

       " 'When Jane Sanders visited one of known bigot and champion of racial profiling Sheriff Joe Arpaio s unconstitutional tent prisons , she was appalled . Arpaio doesn t understand the meaning of cruel and unusual punishment . He forces prisoners to live in smoldering heat and eat expired foods . Since the majority of his inmates are Hispanic people , Arpaio and his racist freak constituents couldn t care less . They follow a doctrine that embraces prosecuting and jailing people simply for the color of their skin to begin with.Mrs . Sanders ended up in a heated argument with Arpaio , one her senator and presidential candidate husband simply couldn t ignore . According to The New York Times , Sanders railed against Arpaio at a campaign event , laying waste to the man he says ambushed his wife : She asked him about racial profiling , and he didn t have an answer , Sanders said , She asked him about conditions in Tent City and other abuses that he has perpetuated , and he didn t have an answer . You know what , he can not have an answer , because what he is doing is un-American and uncivilized . If elected president , we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship , whether Mr. Arpaio likes it or not . Sheriff Arpaio has been widely criticized , and rightfully so , for his tactics for keeping his jail stocked with minority inmates . He was even sued by the Justice Department for the illegal racial profiling of Hispanics that leads to traffic stops and arrests , often for misdemeanor offenses white people get tickets for . His intolerance and racism has made him a national spectacle on many occasions . Conservatives love him because he embodies all they aspire to be in life : openly hateful racists who are allowed to look down on people for no reason other than their accent.Senator Sanders had a stern warning for Sheriff Arpaio : It s easy for bullies like Sheriff Arpaio to pick on people who have no power . If I am elected president the President of the United States does have power . So watch out , Joe . Aside from everything we already know about Bernie Sanders we can add this very useful piece of information : Don t mess with his wife.Featured image from Gage Skidmore',\n",

       " 'ANKARA - The U.S. Embassy in Turkey said on Tuesday that visa appointments were only available from early 2019 , due to an accumulation of applications following a diplomatic spat that prompted the two NATO allies to mutually suspend granting visas . In spite of long wait times , the U.S. Mission to Turkey continues to process non-immigrant visas . Appointments are available for January 2019 , and applicants can as always choose to apply outside of Turkey , it said . The United States in November resumed limited visa services in Turkey after getting what it said were assurances about the safety of its local staff . Washington halted issuing visas at its missions in Turkey in October , citing the detention of two local employees . Turkey soon matched the move , relaxing a visa ban of its own that was instituted in retaliation against Washington . However , Turkey said it had not offered assurances . In May , a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and , more recently , a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) worker was detained in Istanbul . Both are accused of links to last year s coup attempt . The U.S. embassy has said the accusations are baseless . Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over the cleric Fethullah Gulen , who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999 and whom Ankara blames for orchestrating the coup . U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition .',\n",

       " 'BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday dismissed the idea that her Christian Democrats ( CDU ) defeat in a regional election had made her already tricky job of forming a three-way national coalition even harder . It was sufficiently hard enough anyway , she said . Still reeling from their worst national result since 1949 in September s national election , Merkel s conservatives slumped to 33.6 percent in the northern state of Lower Saxony , their poorest showing in the rich agricultural province in nearly six decades . I don t see the Lower Saxony election result as weakening us in this ( coalition ) task , Merkel said , adding that regional issues had played a big role in the campaign there . The Social Democrats ( SPD ) won the vote in Lower Saxony - home to carmaker Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) , which is enmeshed in a diesel emissions scandal - with 36.9 percent , despite lagging far behind the conservatives when campaigning began in August . Education was one of the key campaign topics . Three weeks after her poor national showing , Merkel is about to begin what look set to be thorny coalition discussions with the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) and the Greens on forming a Jamaica alliance - so named because the parties colors correspond with those of the Jamaican flag . Merkel said her conservative bloc was heading into the talks knowing it was the strongest of the three groups , while acknowledging negotiations would be challenging . We ll have sufficient conflicts anyway . No one is under any illusions about that , Merkel said . Policy areas over which the three parties are expected to clash include migration , climate and the euro zone . Greens co-leader Simone Peter said the talks would be tough due to the parties vastly diverging programs , adding : We must now pull ourselves together and see if coalition negotiations are possible or not . The conservatives will meet the FDP and Greens separately on Wednesday and then hold three-way discussions on Friday . Merkel said she expected the exploratory talks - an initial stage during which parties decide whether to go ahead with full-blown coalition negotiations - to last several weeks because the Jamaica alliance , untested at the national level , was an extraordinary political constellation . Horst Seehofer , head of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) - the CDU s Bavarian sister party - said the time before Christmas needed to be used to form a stable government but his colleague Alexander Dobrindt was skeptical : Whether it succeeds , whether a government is formed , is yet to be seen , he said . Carsten Nickel , deputy research director at Teneo Intelligence , said the weak CDU result would particularly worry the CSU , which faces a regional election next year . The CSU will fear that Lower Saxony demonstrates that the popular backlash against Merkel s choices in the 2015 migration crisis is not yet over , he said , referring to her decision to operate an open-borders policy that allowed more than a million migrants to enter Germany . After the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) took almost a million voters from the conservative bloc in September s national election , the sister conservative parties put a long-running internal dispute to bed by agreeing to limit numbers of migrants coming to Germany .',\n",
       " '- Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has moved to the left in key policy areas such as trade during her primary campaign against rival U.S . Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , who is known for his liberal stances . Here is a look at what the former secretary of state has said she would do should she win the White House in the Nov. 8 election . These policies are drawn from white papers released by her campaign , stump speeches , debates and interviews . Clinton supports comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full citizenship . She has pledged to defend President Barack Obama ’ s executive actions on immigration and , if legally possible , expand on them . She has called for an end to deportation raids and family detentions . Clinton has , however , disagreed with liberal Democrats about the best way to handle the influx of young people fleeing cartel violence and other issues in Central America . Obama said in 2014 that the United States would send these youths back to deter others from attempting the same dangerous journey – a position that Clinton has defended , including in a recent presidential debate . “ The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message , because we knew that so many of these children were being abused , being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border , ” Clinton said . “ I think now what I ’ ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child , so that the right decision , hopefully , can be made. ” Clinton supports some free-trade agreements and opposes others , saying her decisions are based on whether she feels the specific agreement will adequately protect the interests of U.S. workers . Clinton has had to deal with the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement reached by her husband ’ s administration during her own political career . She backed away from NAFTA when she ran for a U.S. Senate seat representing New York . As a senator , she supported trade agreements with Australia , Chile , Morocco , Oman and Singapore . She opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement . During her first presidential campaign in 2008 , she criticized possible agreements with Colombia , Panama and South Korea . But once she became Obama ’ s secretary of state , she worked to finalize agreements with Colombia and South Korea – a deal that in 2007 she had called “ inherently unfair. ” Clinton also worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) as secretary of state , saying it would be the “ gold standard ” of trade agreements . As a presidential candidate in 2015 , she stalled on taking a position on TPP , saying she would wait until it was finalized by the administration . Clinton eventually said she would not support TPP because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers . Clinton has pledged to not raise taxes on the middle class in any way , in contrast to Sanders , her Democratic rival , who favors a nominal income tax premium to fund universal healthcare . Clinton has focused on “ reforming the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair share. ” She has proposed ending the carried interest loophole that categorizes the bulk of a hedge fund manager ’ s income as return on investment and not compensation ; enacting the “ Buffett Rule ” so the wealthy with investment income do not pay lower effective tax rates than “ truck drivers or nurses ; ” and pushing back against “ quarterly capitalism ” and incentivizing long-term investment by Wall Street . Clinton has called for an “ intelligence surge ” to combat the Islamic State militant group , and diplomatic efforts feature prominently in most of her foreign policy plans . She does not believe there should be a surge in ground troops in the Middle East , including in Syria . She has said she supports increased “ specialized forces ” there and enforcing a no-fly zone . She believes Russia ’ s participation will be essential for any solution in Syria . Clinton has also called for stepped-up efforts by U.S. technology companies to combat terrorism . In a major foreign policy speech she said “ social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan , provoke or celebrate violence. ” She has not said how far she would go to compel the cooperation of private companies in this effort .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on President Donald Trump ’ s executive order on immigration clarifying that legal permanent residents , or green card holders , do not require a waiver to enter the United States . “ They no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident they won ’ t need it anymore , ” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing . The restriction on green card holders was among the most confusing element in the executive order signed on Friday . Initially , administration officials said such permanent legal residents were barred from entry under the executive order , although they could apply for a waiver and be rescreened . After the ensuing outcry — including legal challenges — over legal residents being detained , the Homeland Security Department said on Sunday green card holders would be allowed on planes to the United States and would be assessed upon arrival . “ We expect swift entry for these individuals , ” DHS said . Spicer said the White House counsel issued an update on Wednesday to clarify that those legal permanent residents no longer need a waiver . “ Initially , as the program was lifting off , the idea was that they would go through be granted a waiver , of which everyone was , ” Spicer told the news briefing . “ In the sake of efficiency , we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies ... that that does not apply , they no longer need a waiver . ”',\n",
       " 'It s really a pretty simple scheme . Obama is placing Democrat voters ( illegal aliens who are given housing , education , food , health care and ultimately citizenship in exchange for their votes ) in unsuspecting communities across the USA . Our safety and the safety of our nation is really of no consequence to a man and his family who will be surrounded by secret service for the rest of his life . There seems to be a particular focus on populating red states with illegal aliens and refugees in hopes that can give their party the boost it needs to put those states in play when the elections roll around Part of the supposed mission of DHS is to transport individuals apprehended in the country illegally from our soil to their own . They might stop and spend some time on our soil behind bars , but the general direction of travel and the paperwork is , in theory , towards their home country . That was before the enemies of America took over our country , Hussein Obama in the White House and Jihadi Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security . Now everything is backwards . There often is no paperwork to track the individuals or direct their travel , just a white van , loaded with illegal aliens pointed north , towards the interior of the United States and a Phoenix bus station . We all remember the uproar over the DHS buses with mirrored windows that were the subject of protests last year . Now DHS is using stealth to bypass the angered American people and it s working.According to a report by Judicial Watch , Homeland Security is still secretly transporting illegal aliens into the interior of the United States , those same shadows that they will later disingenuously claim to be wanting desperately to rescue them from . They ll be the families that can t be broken up and can t be transported together back to where they belong . They re the immovable squatters who are dictating what will and won t be done to them through the corrupt government that is using them as pawns to advance their agenda.The good people who make up the rank and file members of the CBP and ICE aren t happy about what they are being forced to do and the destructive impact it s having on our nation . Judicial Watch wrote : The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents , Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch . The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican ( OTM ) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way . Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road.This report , part of an ongoing Judicial Watch investigation into the security risks along the southern border , features only a snippet of a much broader crisis in which illegal aliens are being released and vanishing into unsuspecting American communities . The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest addressed this issue just a few weeks ago in a hearing called Declining Deportations and Increasing Criminal Alien Releases The Lawless Immigration Policies of the Obama Administration . Judd , the Border Patrol Union chief , delivered alarming figures at the hearing . He estimated that about 80 % of apprehended illegal immigrants are released into the United States . This includes unaccompanied minors who are escorted to their final destination , family units and those who claim to have a credible fear of persecution in their native country . Single males that aren t actually seen crossing into the U.S. by Border Patrol agents are released if they claim to have been in the country since 2014 , Judd added.The OTMs are from Honduras , Colombia , El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix . Authorities didn t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they re in the country legally , according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter . American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a credible fear , Border Patrol sources told JW . None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents , but were told to promise they d show up for a hearing when notified , said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation.A security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix , sources said . The firm is called G4S and claims to be the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees . G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter , Florida.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there s no room to keep them in detention . They re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go , said one law enforcement official in Arizona . Just move those bodies across the country . Officially , DHS denies this is occurring . Of course DHS denies it s happening . They are violating their oaths , the public trust and the United States Constitution ; it s not likely they ll confess . But there is no doubt it is , and that it is they and not the rank and file members who are lying.The real question that needs to be asked is why it is happening . Why has an agency that is responsible for border enforcement evolved into a mechanism for facilitating border violations or was this its intended function from its subversive beginning ?

       " 'OSLO - The United States could influence or even disrupt work by other nations to combat climate change until late 2020 even if President Donald Trump quits a global agreement , legal scholars said on Wednesday . Trump will honor a campaign pledge to pull out of the 195-nation Paris Agreement , a source briefed on the decision told on Tuesday . Trump tweeted he would announce his formal decision “ over the next few days ” . U.N. rules for the 2015 pact , which seeks to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century , say Washington would formally have to wait until November 2020 to withdraw . Trump could shorten the formalities to just one year by exiting Paris ’ 1992 parent treaty . Quitting the Paris Agreement would leave Trump in a legal grey zone until the next U.S. presidential election in 2020 , retaining a vote as other nations work on detailed rules on issues such as how to monitor greenhouse gas emissions . In the worst case “ the U.S. could make it more difficult to adopt the Paris rules ” , said Daniel Bodansky , a law professor at Arizona State University . “ To the extent that ( withdrawal from Paris ) is already going to harm relations with our allies , staying in and being obstructionist would be even more harmful , ” he said . Trump has promised to promote the coal industry over renewables . Bodansky noted , however , that Washington did not try to obstruct other nations ’ work on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which obliged rich nations to cut emissions , after President George W. Bush angered U.S. allies by deciding in 2001 not to take part . Megan Bowman , a law lecturer at King ’ s College , London , said the four-year waiting period was partly intended to insulate the agreement from a shift to a Republican presidency after Democratic President Barack Obama . “ The downside ... is that if they ( the United States ) are recalcitrant they are sitting at the table , able to obstruct or stall the process , ” she said . Paris imposes few legal obligations before 2020 and has no sanctions for non-compliance . The Paris Agreement ’ s Article 28 says any nation wanting to pull out has to wait three years from the date the agreement gained legal force , which was Nov. 4 , 2016 , before seeking to leave . It then has to wait another year . In Berlin , European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that withdrawal would take years . “ The Americans can ’ t just leave the climate protection agreement . Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn ’ t know the details. ” Trump would be taking a riskier step by withdrawing from Paris ’ parent treaty , the 1992 Climate Convention , even though it would require only a year ’ s notice and void U.S. commitments under Paris . That Convention , seeking voluntary actions to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and a landmark in cooperation between rich and poor nations , has had bipartisan U.S. support . It was signed by Republican President George Bush . Paris goes one step further by obliging all nations to set domestic targets to curb emissions to limit a creeping rise in temperatures blamed for more heat waves , downpours and rising sea levels . Leaving the Convention would make the United States an “ international pariah on global climate change ” , said Robert Stavins , director of Harvard University ’ s environmental economics program . Johan Rockstrom , director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre , said a U.S. presence in the Paris negotiations until 2020 would be “ the most negative thing ... they would still be allowed to vote in the room ” . But he said a quick , clean break by the United States from the 1992 Convention might be best for other nations which could then work without risks of obstruction .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors in Alexandria , Virginia , have expanded a long-running grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks to include the leak of Central Intelligence Agency documents to the website , a source familiar with the inquiry said . The source , who is familiar with the investigation and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information , said the probe is focused on who leaked descriptions and technical information on techniques and tools the CIA has used to eavesdrop on intelligence targets to the website . U.S. agencies have made only vague public comments on the latest WikiLeaks disclosures , but security and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said in the wake of the leaks that it is focused on whether an intelligence contractor was responsible . At this point , they said , investigators do not think Russia or another foreign government was involved . U.S. officials have confirmed that Alexandria-based prosecutors have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation into WikiLeaks and its sources . Some court documents on elements of the inquiry have been made public . The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment , as did a spokesman for the CIA , which has not publicly confirmed the authenticity of the material made public by WikiLeaks .

       " 'CODY , Wyo . - Former Vice President Dick Cheney ’ s eldest daughter , bouncing back from an aborted 2014 U.S. Senate bid , heads into a crowded primary race next week for Wyoming ’ s lone seat in the House of Representatives buoyed by big-name Republicans and wealthy out-of-state donors . Liz Cheney , the apparent Republican front-runner , has commanded a level of fund-raising and A-list party support - including two former presidents and onetime Cabinet members - that is rare , if not unheard of , for a relative newcomer to Wyoming politics . Her strength is even more significant in a solidly red state where the Republican primary winner is virtually assured victory in the general election . “ She can go to Chicago or New York , and in one fund-raiser pull in more money than the next two closest candidates combined , ” said Deb Oakley Simpson , a daughter-in-law of former longtime Wyoming Republican Senator Alan Simpson and a Cody-based civic activist who backs one of Cheney ’ s primary foes , state Senator Leland Christensen . To date , Cheney , 49 , has received individual donations totaling more than $ 1.1 million , far outpacing the collective campaign receipts of her seven Republican opponents and the two Democrats running in Wyoming ’ s primary elections on Tuesday . According to the latest opinion poll on the race , conducted during the second week of July , more than half of Wyoming voters were undecided , but Cheney led with 21 percent , more than twice the following of her nearest competitor . Her standing marks a striking turnaround from her first bid for public office , when she returned to her home state three years ago to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was branded by some fellow Republicans as a “ carpetbagger ” backed by deep-pocketed outsiders . Her campaign also suffered from a public feud with her sister Mary Cheney , a lesbian , over Liz Cheney ’ s opposition to same-sex marriage . She ended up withdrawing from that race several months later , citing a family health crisis . Cheney and her husband , Phil Perry , an attorney , have five children . Now Cheney , also a lawyer who worked in the State Department while her father was vice president , is leveraging her Washington connections as she runs for the open , at-large House seat in the nation ’ s least populous state . Campaigning as a “ strong conservative voice for Wyoming , ” she has vowed to protect the state ’ s pivotal coal industry , defend gun rights and generally work “ to reverse President Obama ’ s devastating policies. ” Among her contributors are a prominent group of her father ’ s former high-ranking government colleagues , including former Presidents George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush , as well as former Secretary of State James Baker , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former White House political adviser Karl Rove . Other prominent donors include New York Jets owner Woody Johnson , Colorado oil and entertainment magnate Philip Anschutz , brewing executive Pete Coors , Texas financier T. Boone Pickens , and Chicago real estate and media investor Sam Zell . Cheney ’ s two closest Republican primary rivals are state Representative Tim Stubson and Christensen , who rank second and third , respectively , in fund-raising and in polls . They have raised $ 255,000 combined in individual donations . Cheney , who was on the campaign trail and unavailable for comment , has accepted no political action committee funds , and PAC funding has figured little in the race . She raised the bulk of her campaign money by the end of March , with nearly half of individual contributions meeting the $ 2,700 limit set by federal election laws . Most came from outside Wyoming . Still , Cheney “ has raised more money from more Wyoming donors than any of her opponents , ” and contributions from all 50 states , campaign manager Bill Novotny said . “ A national effort is what it ’ s going to take to stand up to Hillary Clinton ” at the top of the Democratic ticket in November , he added .',\n",

Trump ’ s comments could give a push to efforts to revive the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial lending from investment banking . Reviving such a law would require an act by Congress . “ I ’ m looking at that right now , ” Trump said on Monday in an interview with Bloomberg News in the Oval Office . “ There ’ s some people that want to go back to the old system , right ? So we ’ re going to look at that. ” While campaigning for president , Trump had expressed support on the campaign trail for a “ 21st-century Glass-Steagall. ” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing that Trump had expressed interest in the issue and had been briefed on it by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin but was not ready to discuss it publicly . “ We ’ re not at a point where we ’ re ready to roll out details of that yet , ” Spicer said . “ He is actively looking at options and considering things. ” One of Trump ’ s top economic advisers , Gary Cohn , director of the National Economic Council , reiterated Trump ’ s support for the concept during a private meeting with lawmakers on April 6 , a White House spokesperson told Reuters .

       " 'HONOLULU - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law an annual defense policy bill , but in a lengthy statement he raised objections to parts of it , including policies blocking him from closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Obama pledged in his 2008 presidential campaign to close the military prison , but his efforts have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress . The Democratic president has instead reduced the population there by transferring prisoners to other countries . The administration recently told Congress it would move up to 18 more prisoners of the 59 remaining at Guantanamo before Obama leaves office next month . “ During my administration , we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees from Guantanamo , ” Obama said in the statement on Friday . “ Our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day I am in office. ” President-elect Donald Trump , who will be sworn in on Jan. 20 , said during the campaign that he would keep the Guantanamo Bay facility open and vowed to “ load it up with some bad dudes. ” The $ 618.7 billion defense spending bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress this month was a compromise version that dropped controversial language requiring women to register for the draft . But it kept some Republican-backed initiatives Obama had opposed . The legislation boosts military spending when there has been no similar increase in non-defense funding , and it bars closures of military bases even though top Pentagon officials say they have too much capacity . House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan , a Republican , said on Friday the legislation would give U.S. troops a pay raise and praised the Guantanamo language . “ This ensures that , right up until his last hour in office , President Obama will not be able to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States , ” Ryan said in a statement . Obama ’ s predecessor George W. Bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the Sept. 11 attacks . Under Bush , the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture . Obama has maintained for years that he considers “ onerous restrictions ” on his ability to transfer prisoners a violation of the U.S. Constitution ’ s separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch . But he gave no indication he would try to override those restrictions . Reflecting the growing migration of espionage and warfare into cyberspace , Obama also said on Friday that he favors splitting the U.S. Cyber Command , which conducts offensive operations , from the National Security Agency and making it independent , similar to the military ’ s European and Pacific Commands .',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump may call his disaster of a raid in Yemen last week a success , but the rest of the world views it as just one of the more deadly ways in which he has demonstrated his ineptitude and now we are paying the price.Not only did Trump completely miss his main target , Qassim al-Rimi , who is currently mocking him , but the poorly-planned raid slaughtered 30 civilians including 10 women and children ( one of them a U.S. citizen ) . Three U.S. service members were injured and a Navy SEAL was killed.So what went wrong ? Everything.Trump reportedly decided to go ahead with the raid over dinner after his cabinet convinced him it was the right thing to do by telling him that Obama would not have the balls to go through with him ( seriously , that s all it took ) . According to a senior U.S. intelligence official , almost everything went wrong once the team arrived . Officials say Trump approved the attack without sufficient intelligence , ground support or adequate backup preparations . On top of failing to kill his target , slaughtering civilians wholesale , murdering a U.S. citizen , and getting a SEAL killed with his bumbling mess of an operation , the intel that was gathered is garbage . The military is touting three videos they recovered from the raid as evidence of success but the videos are a decade old and available on YouTube.Because of all this , Yemen has decided that they don t want Trump coming in and wrecking their living room again . The New York Times reports : Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by President Trump , Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country , according to American officials.Grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a 50-minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in Yemen . A member of the Navy s SEAL Team 6 , Chief Petty Officer William Owens , was also killed in the operation.While the White House continues to insist that the attack was a success a characterization it repeated on Tuesday the suspension of commando operations is a setback for Mr. Trump , who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against Islamic militants . The fool of the White House got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands , al-Rimi said in a video following Trump s failed raid . Yemen s decision not to let Trump play with his toys in their house is a bit uncomfortable for The Donald , who promised to step up our approach to fighting terrorism . Now that he is President , he has done nothing but hurt that effort.Watch a report on the raid below : Featured image via Getty Images/Pool',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - While attention in Asia has been distracted by the North Korean nuclear crisis in the past year , China has continued to install high-frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man-made islands in the South China Sea , a U.S. think tank said on Thursday . Chinese activity has involved work on facilities covering 72 acres ( 29 hectares ) of the Spratly and Paracel islands , territory contested with several other Asian nations , according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative of Washington s Center for Strategic and International Studies . The report cited satellite images . The United States and its allies oppose China s building of artificial islands in the South China Sea and their militarization , given concerns Beijing plans to use them to deny access to strategic routes . It s completely normal for China to conduct peaceful construction and build essential defense equipment on its own sovereign territory , China s foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular press briefing on Friday , in response to a question about the report . We believe certain people who have ulterior motives are making mountains out of molehills and stirring up trouble . The report said that in the last several months China had constructed what appeared to be a new high-frequency radar array at the northern end of Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratlys . Subi Reef had seen tunnels completed that were likely for ammunition storage and another radar antenna array and radar domes , the report said . Construction on Mischief Reef included underground storage for ammunition and hangars , missile shelters and radar arrays . Smaller-scale work had continued in the Paracel Islands , including a new helipad and wind turbines on Tree Island and two large radar towers on Triton Island . It said the latter were especially important as waters around Triton had been the scene of recent incidents between China and Vietnam and multiple U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations , which the U.S. navy has used to assert what it sees as its right to free passage in international waters . Woody Island , China s military and administrative headquarters in the South China Sea , saw two first-time air deployments that hint at things to come at the three Spratly Island air bases farther south , the report said . At the end of October , the Chinese military released images showing J-11B fighters at Woody Island for exercises , while on Nov. 15 , AMTI spotted what appeared to be Y-8 transport planes , a type that can be configured for electronic surveillance . The Pentagon has conducted several patrols near Chinese-held South China Sea territory this year , even as it has sought China s help in northeast Asia to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program . On Tuesday , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated a call for a freeze in China s island building and said it was unacceptable to continue their militarization .',\n",
       " 'We always knew that Donald Trump was a heartless bastard . However , he just decided to leave no doubt about that fact in the minds of the American people , as the orange one has decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , which is an Obama-era program that protects children who arrived in the United States illegally when they were very young from deportation . The announcement came late Sunday night , as millions of people waited anxiously to see what the fate of their family members and friends and for DACA recipients , themselves would be.According to Politico , Trump will phase the program out within six months , leaving 800,000 DACA recipients subject to immediate deportation . It seems that the six month waiting period to start deporting DACA recipients , also known as DREAMERS , is to give Congress time to solve the problem of undocumented children themselves . The argument seems to be that a lot of people in Trump s orbit believe that immigration policies like DACA are the job of lawmakers , not the president , and therefore President Obama had no right to do what he did for the DREAMERS.This all comes as many lawmakers including many Republicans have said that Trump should leave the DACA kids alone . After all , these are people who know no other home , who came here as very small children and are Americans in every way except on paper . They literally have nowhere to go if Trump and his goons deport them.Now , it should be noted that this is not an official announcement and that it came from White House sources with knowledge of the upcoming announcement who spoke to Politico reporters . Since Trump is impulsive and unpredictable , there is still time for all of this to change . Hopefully , Congress will do something during the six-month window , rendering this awful decision moot.Anyone who thought this administration wouldn t be on a mission to destroy the lives of millions of people was completely deluded . We now see that Team Trump is on their way to making America into their fever dream of a white ethnostate or as close to it as they can come . That s what you get when dumb people decide it would be a great idea to have a racist run the country.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter',\n",

An ambush in Niger that killed four U.S. soldiers in October has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counterterrorism mission in the West African country .

It includes a $ 100 million drone base in the central Nigerien city of Agadez which at present only deploys surveillance drones .

       " 'BRUSSELS - The European Commission on Wednesday stepped up legal action against Hungary over restrictions on foreign funding likely to affect civil society groups funded by the billionaire investor George Soros . The EU executive believes the law , passed in June , violates the right to freedom of association and to protection of private life and personal data enshrined in the EU s Charter of Fundamental Rights , as well as breaching the principle of free movement of capital . Hungary s right-wing prime minister , Viktor Orban , has long criticized organizations funded by the Hungarian-born Soros , accusing them of working as paid activists advocating Soros s political goals , notably by opposing Orban s tough immigration policy . When Soros in June praised the courageous way Hungarians have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state Orban has established , Orban called it a declaration of war , and accused Soros of running a mafia-like network . The Commission expressed its concerns over the law on non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) to Budapest in July , the latest in a long line of grievances about what Brussels and many member states see as a track record of flouting fundamental EU values . Having carefully analyzed the explanations put forward by Hungary , the European Commission concludes that its serious concerns have not been addressed , it said in Wednesday s statement . The Commission s next step in the infringement procedure is to issue a so-called reasoned opinion , giving Hungary one month to take the requested measures . If Hungary fails to reply satisfactorily to the reasoned opinion , then the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU , the statement said . The Commission has already issued a similar ultimatum to Hungary over an education law that Brussels says infringes academic freedom and could result in the closure of a Budapest university founded by Soros . Since coming to power in 2010 , Orban has eliminated checks on his power by taking control of much of Hungary s media , curbing the powers of the constitutional court and placing loyalists in top positions at public institutions . While Brussels can open cases against EU states violating common rules , they are lengthy and often have little impact . That means the EU executive has little leverage over Orban , who has been in office since 2010 and faces an election next year .',\n",

       " \"NEW DELHI - India s western state of Rajasthan on Tuesday deferred until next year a measure requiring government permission for the publication of details regarding judges and public servants who face accusations over action taken in the course of their duty . The measure , which prescribes jail terms of up to two years for violations , aimed to minimise frivolous complaints against officials , said the government of the state , ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Hindu nationalist party . In recent years many journalists reporting corruption and attacks on minorities in India have complained of being targeted by online smear campaigns , although there have been no reports of measures elsewhere similar to what Rajasthan proposed . The Editors Guild of India and the opposition Congress party called Rajasthan s move an attempt to curb media freedom and shield corrupt individuals , criticisms that forced the state to delay discussion on the bill . The government has agreed to refer the bill to a panel of legislature members , a state government spokesman told by telephone , adding that the bill could be introduced , following amendments , in the next assembly session early next year . When introduced this week in the state assembly , it set a six-month deadline for courts to secure the government s permission for any investigations into the actions of judges , magistrates or public servants . In the absence of such permission , it also sought to block publication of the identity , or other personal , or family details of those being investigated . `` No one shall print or publish , or publicize in any manner , the name , address , photograph , family details , or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of a judge or magistrate or a public servant , '' it added .

       " 'She burst on the scene last August when she upset a 44-year incumbent Democrat in the Minnesota state primary elections to become the nation s first female Muslim state legislator.Ilhan Omar , the 34-year-old community organizer who came to America as a refugee from Somalia , was touted by Democrats as a model success story . From a refugee camp to the State Capitol with intelligence and insight , beamed former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak , who endorsed Omar . This is a wonderful story to tell as Americans , and a great source of pride for the state of Minnesota s open arms . But on Thursday Omar made her mark in another way.She was one of only two members of the Minnesota State House to vote against a bill that would allow life insurance companies to deny payouts to the beneficiaries of terrorists who die in violent attacks on Americans.Omar , who represents the heavily immigrant Cedar Riverside area of Minneapolis , was joined by fellow Democratic Rep. John Lesch of St. Paul in voting against the bill.Omar s vote sticks out because at least 42 Somali refugees have been confirmed by the FBI to have left the U.S. to join overseas terrorist organizations , including al-Shabab , the al-Qaida affiliate in Somalia , and ISIS in Syria and Iraq.Dozens of other Somali-Americans have been tried and/or convicted of providing material support to overseas terrorists.The Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to the nation s largest Somali refugee community.The Minnesota insurance bill was introduced by Rep. Joe Hoppe , R-Chaska , in response to Syed Farook s jihadist rampage in San Bernardino , California , in December 2015 in which he shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 at an office Christmas party . Farook made sure his life insurance policies worth $ 275,000 were valid before conducting the deadly shooting with help from his wife , Tashfeen Malik.After Farook died in a shootout with police , his mother fought to remain the beneficiary of the life insurance policies . The insurance company balked and the case has gone to court.Democratic Rep. Debra Hilstrom said the goal of the Minnesota bill is to make certain that folks don t benefit [ from terrorism ] and this limits the beneficiary to the premiums that were paid in . It limits the exposure for the insurance company when someone is committing an act of terrorism . WNDWatch :',\n",

A Facebook page for someone with the same name in Indiana shows a young man posing next to a white Acura with the same license plate as the car searched in Santa Monica for the weapons and explosives.At a news conference Sunday afternoon , police stressed they were still trying to figure out what Howell planned to do with the weapons.Howell s friend and fellow car club member Joseph Greeson , 18 , said Howell didn t harbor any ill will toward gays or lesbians.Greeson said Howell s family in Jeffersonville hadn t seen him for days and that his parents had called Greeson s parents looking for him.He added that Howell was known to have a gun collection.According to Indiana court records , Howell was charged in October 2015 with intimidation and felony pointing a firearm at another person . On April 19 , Howell pleaded guilty to misdemeanor intimidation , and prosecutors dropped the pointing a firearm charge . Court records show he was sentenced to a year in state prison and placed on probation . Under the deal , He agreed to forfeit all weapons during his term of probation.Oct 21 , 2015- Around 11:17 p.m. Thursday , Oct. 15 , Charlestown Police Department officers were dispatched to Winthrop Drive to investigate a report of James W. Howell , 19 , pointing a gun at his neighbors , according to a police report.When the officers arrived , the neighbors pointed out Howell , who was then handcuffed until the officers could determine the nature of the allegations . While doing so , one officer noticed a Smith and Wesson handgun sticking out of the back waistband of his pants , which the officer secured in his car.One of the neighbors who reportedly had the gun pointed at him told officers he , his wife and several other neighbors and friends had been sitting on the porch having beers and discussing his cat being poisoned several months ago . At that point , a woman who lives at Howell s residence with her husband , who was on the porch , came around from the back of the house yelling that they were talking about her and calling her names . An argument ensued between the woman and the complainant , and Howell went into his residence and returned with a gun , witnesses said.The complainant said Howell pointed the gun at him and his wife , who said she would call the police . Howell withdrew the gun and went into the house.The officers said that the other complainants and witness stories were consistent and none seemed intoxicated . Two of them referred to an incident earlier in the day in which Howell had pointed his gun at his boyfriend . A report was taken after this incident as well . James is going to get someone hurt , one witness said . He needs to stop pointing guns at people . Federal and local law enforcement decided against canceling the annual parade , which went forward Sunday morning under tightened security . Investigators are now trying to piece together what happened but said they don t believe there is any connection between the incident and the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando , Fla. , that killed at least 50 people overnight.Early Sunday , Santa Monica police received a call about a suspected prowler who was knocking on a resident s door and window about 5 a.m. in the 1700 block of 11th Street , Santa Monica police said .

Officers inspected the car and found three assault rifles , high-capacity ammunition and a five-gallon bucket containing chemicals capable of forming an improvised explosive device , police said.A law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the contents of the bucket included tannerite , an ingredient that could be used to create a pipe bomb . The maker of the material said that was not the case and that it can only be detonated by high-velocity impact such as a bullet strike . But tannerite is known as a material used in the construction of other types of explosive devices.The source , who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation , said authorities also found camouflage clothing in the car.Los Angeles County sheriff s officials said the suspect told police he was going to the Pride parade to look for a friend . Authorities were looking for that individual.Santa Monica police spokesman Saul Rodriguez said detectives are not aware of what the suspect s intentions were at this point . Santa Monica police continued to search the suspect s white Acura on Sunday morning . All four of the car s doors were open and a green blanket , red gasoline canister and several other smaller items were being piled on the sidewalk next to it . The car s license plate included a symbol of the National Rifle Assn . on the left side and the bottom said , Teaching Freedom . A Facebook page for Howell said he attended high school in Louisville , Ky. , and lives in Jeffersonville , Ind. , where he works for an air filtration company . A car enthusiast , Howell posted numerous photographs of the Acura along with a couple of videos taken from inside cars . Another 10-second video includes gunfire , with shots striking grass.Here is the comment James Wesley Howell made under the pro-Bernie Sanders meme : The site includes political posts , including one in which he compares Hillary Clinton to Adolf Hitler . In another , he repeats conspiracy theories that the government was behind notorious terrorist attacks , including Sept. 11 , 2011 . That post shares a video claiming that last year s terror attack on the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo was a hoax and attributable to the New World Order . They found him with weapons that were very disconcerting , said one source , adding officials are taking the appropriate safety precautions . One source in West Hollywood said there was discussion of calling off the parade but that officials decided to go forward , with heavy security including undercover officers in the crowd .

       " 'O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule . WASHINGTON A federal judge in Texas on Saturday issued a nationwide injunction halting enforcement of Obama administration protections for transgender and abortion-related healthcare services just one day before they were due to go into effect . The lawsuit brought by Texas , a handful of other states , and some religiously affiliated nonprofit medical groups challenges a regulation implementing the sex nondiscrimination requirement found in the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) . The Health and Human Services ( HHS ) regulation forbids discriminating on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy under Obamacare , as US District Court Judge Reed O Connor wrote in his opinion halting enforcement of those provisions in the rule.Specifically , the ACA provision Section 1557 prohibits discrimination in federally-funded health benefits , including based on sex . Over the course of 2015 and this year , HHS proposed and finalized a regulation interpreting the definition of sex in that provisions to include gender identity defined as internal sense of gender , which may be male , female , neither , or a combination of male and female as well as sex stereotyping and termination of pregnancy . Explaining the lawsuit , O Connor wrote , Plaintiffs claim the Rule s interpretation of sex discrimination pressures doctors to deliver healthcare in a manner that violates their religious freedom and thwarts their independent medical judgment and will require burdensome changes to their health insurance plans on January 1 , 2017 . The states and nonprofits in the healthcare lawsuit allege that the regulation violates the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) which sets the rules for federal government rule-making and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) . O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule .

Trump gained 98 votes but lost 92 for a net gain of 6 votes.OVERALLClinton gained 3 votes Trump gained 6 votes Net Trump gain of 3 votes on Day 2Trump won Wisconsin by more than 22,000 votes.That means that Trump inched ahead by a grand total of 3 votes in a recount expected to cost more than $ 3.5 million . Green Party nominee Jill Stein raised more than $ 6 million to fund recounts in Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania . The latter two recounts are now bogged down in legal issues and challenges . On December 3 , Stein dropped her request for a Pennsylvania recount , saying she couldn t afford the $ 1 million required , even though she raised $ 7 million overall for recounts . Clinton would have needed all three states Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Michigan to flip in order to take the White House back from Trump , an exceedingly tall order.In Wisconsin , Trump supporters sued to stop the recount , alleging it was not being conducted uniformly ( some counties use paper ballots and others use machines ) .

       " 'Sometimes , the left just makes it far too easy to win.It is a well-known fact that President Trump is a big fan of FNC s FOX & Friends , tweeting about it often .

The stars offer him flattery , encouragement and advice . While furthering his point , Poniewozik complimented the morning show by calling it the most powerful TV show in America due to Trump s support . Instead of getting mad , FNC got even .

       " 'SEOUL - By the time Donald Trump departed Seoul on Wednesday , the sometimes bellicose American president seemed to have mollified South Koreans who had been bracing for more confrontational rhetoric over North Korea , trade , and defense spending . Throughout his 24-hour swing through South Korea , Trump , who in a September speech at the United Nations had threatened to totally destroy North Korea and had dismissed dialogue with Pyongyang as a waste of time , took a more restrained tone . In his first trip to South Korea as president , Trump also significantly toned down his criticism of what he once called a horrible free trade deal with South Korea . He says now he will find a fair and reciprocal deal after earlier threatening to terminate the pact . The apparent newfound bond between Trump and liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in , and the U.S. President s willingness to make a deal with North Korea - albeit on his terms - could begin to assuage fears of a catastrophic war with nuclear-armed North Korea . Trump s willingness to talk about revising the bilateral trade agreement , rather than scrapping it entirely , could also reassure markets worried about the fallout on major exporters such as Samsung , Hyundai and LG Electronics . Trump s speech to South Korea s National Assembly on Wednesday , interrupted by applause about 20 times with a standing ovation at the end , praised a free and flourishing South , in contrast to the horror of life in North Korea . On South Korea s largest internet portal , Naver.com , some of Moon s supporters welcomed the address . They said Trump displayed a greater knowledge of the two Koreas than his previous statements had indicated . Far from the madman the media portrays , Trump came across as perfectly normal , smart , and well-mannered , read one of the more than 1,200 posts on Naver.com . Another wrote : Wow , best speech ever . I feel so safe to have such a great U.S. president who is so determined to resolve North Korean issues . Naver.com blocks out the usernames on comments to keep them anonymous . South Koreans were feeling a little less safe earlier this week when the Pentagon , in a letter to U.S. lawmakers , gave a blunt assessment of what war on the Korea peninsula would look like . A ground invasion would be the only way to locate and secure all North Korea s nuclear weapons with complete certainty , and Pyongyang could use biological and chemical weapons in any conflict , it said . Seoul , the densely populated capital with some 25 million residents , lies an hour s drive from the border . The U.S. military presence in South Korea has long been seen as a bulwark against the North and its nuclear threat . The United States decisively intervened in the 1950-53 Korean War , which has left the two Korea s technically still at war , since it ended in a truce , not a peace treaty . While the sprawling U.S. military bases housing some 28,500 troops have not been without controversy - some critics contend they undermine the country s sovereignty - the U.S. security umbrella is also deeply embedded in the national psyche . Underscoring the importance Seoul attaches to the alliance at a time of increased tensions with Pyongyang , South Korean officials rolled out a reception fit for the first state visit by an American president in 25 years , according to the presidential Blue House . Moon , who took office in May , had campaigned for more dialogue with North Korea . He appeared to be the target of criticism from Trump , who said after North Korea s nuclear test in September : South Korea is finding , as I have told them , that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work , they only understand one thing ! But Moon led a charm offensive , proclaiming a special bond forged between President Trump and myself after a lengthy meeting at the presidential Blue House . He personally joined Trump during a tour of a U.S. base , as well as during an ultimately aborted visit to the demilitarized zone on the border with North Korea . I wouldn t say we didn t have any concerns , a South Korean government official said . But the fact that he received a standing ovation ( for his speech ) could mean that he dispelled such concerns , delivered the message we wanted him to deliver , and wrapped up his trip successfully , said the official who asked for anonymity , citing the sensitivity of the matter . In his speech to the National Assembly , where several lawmakers brandished signs reading No war , we want peace , Trump paid homage to the 67-year-old alliance that divides the oppressed and the free . He noted that in less than one lifetime , South Korea climbed from total devastation to among the wealthiest nations on earth . Trump also reassured South Koreans the Korean War would not be repeated . We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction . We will not be intimidated . And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here , on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure , he said . And while Trump painted a dystopian picture of life in North Korea , he refrained from any threats of pre-emptive action against the North . On Tuesday , Trump said it would in the North s interest to come to the table and to make a deal . It all seemed reassuring to an anxious South Korean public . I think people might have felt they got to see the real Trump after he visited South Korea , said Kim Jun-seok , a political science professor at Dongguk University . And we heard many things that were positive about South Korea . It was all enough for people to think , Is this the Trump we know ?',\n",
       " 'KATHMANDU - A leftist alliance between Nepal s former Maoist rebels and moderate communists appeared to be heading for a victory in elections aimed at completing a transition to democracy after the abolition of the monarchy and end to civil war . Early tallies from Thursday s vote show the leftists lead in 63 out of 80 constituencies where counting has begun . Nepal has seen 10 government changes in as many years . Instability has given rise to corruption , retarded growth and slowed recovery from a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people . The election pits the centrist Nepali Congress party of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba , who heads a loose alliance that includes the Madhesi parties from Nepal s southern plains and former royalists , against the tight-knit alliance of former Maoists and the moderate Communist UML party . The Nepali Congress party is considered a pro-India group , while the opposition alliance is seen as closer to China . Nepal is a natural buffer between the two and the outcome could indicate whether China or India gets the upper hand in the battle for influence in a nation rich in hydropower and home to Mount Everest . Nepal emerged from a civil war in 2006 and abolished its 239-year-old Hindu monarchy two years later . Guna Raj Luintel , editor of the daily Nagarik , said it was almost certain the leftist alliance would win . Trends so far suggest they could win a two-thirds majority . If that happened , that will be a landslide win , Luintel said . There are 165 seats to be decided on a first-past-the-post basis for which voting was held on Thursday with another 110 seats decided by proportional representation . Few results are in from the southern plains , home to nearly half of the population , and communists are thought to have weaker support there . Final results of the election , Nepal s first under its republican constitution approved by a special Constituent Assembly in 2015 , could take around 10 days due to cumbersome counting procedures .',\n",

The FPO , which is fighting with the Social Democrats for the second place in parliamentary elections on Oct. 15 , has on previous occasions expelled provincial officials for owning Nazi-related objects , which is illegal in Austria . In Germany s election on Sunday , the FPO s sister party AfD won 12.6 percent of the vote , becoming the third-largest group in parliament and the first from the far right to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s . Austria s FPO is poised to become kingmaker as a junior coalition party , with conservative front-runner Sebastian Kurz expected to gain around a third of the vote with his tough rhetoric on fighting immigration and Islamic parallel societies . Martin Hochstoeger stepped back from his post as a member of the FPO Tyrol party executive after pictures were spread in Austrian media of a marble slate engraved with a quote by Adolf Hitler , a swastika and a tally of a local vote in 1938 favoring Austria s annexation by Nazi Germany . Based on current media reports ...

       " \"NEW YORK - Six in 10 American voters support the new ban on people from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States unless they can show they have a close relative here , according to opinion poll results released on Wednesday . The Politico-Morning Consult poll found 37 percent of voters said they “ strongly supported ” the new U.S. State Department guidelines that would deny visas to citizens of Iran , Libya , Syria , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen who do not have close relatives in the United States . Another 23 percent of voters said they “ somewhat support ” the guidelines . The poll was conducted online on Thursday and Friday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that partly upheld the ban , with 1,989 registered voters taking part . The poll results ' margin of error was 2 percentage points , meaning results could vary that much either way . ( Link to the poll : politi.co/2uJLfoO ) The survey asked respondents whether they support or oppose the State Department ’ s new guidelines , “ which say visa applicants from six predominately Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident in order to enter the country. ” It did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump , nor the president ’ s executive orders on immigration . The Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the temporary travel ban could proceed so long as visa applicants with a “ bona fide relationship ” with a person or entity in the United States were exempted . A year before his election , Trump promised voters he would seek a temporary “ total and complete shutdown ” of Muslims entering the United States . Trump said it was necessary to prevent attacks by Islamist militants , while critics said it was a needlessly discriminatory policy that could inflame prejudice against Muslims in the United States and abroad . The partial ban , which took effect on Thursday , was most strongly supported by Trump ’ s fellow Republicans , 83 percent of whom approved . Even among Democratic voters , only 46 percent said they were opposed . Forty-one percent of Democrats said they support it , and the remaining 13 percent said they “ don ’ t know. ” The Supreme Court allowed the ban , which bars people from the designated six countries for 90 days and refugees from any country for 120 days , to take effect until it can take up the case during its next term starting in October .\",\n",
       " 'A member of the Idaho House of Representatives has been punished for making absolutely offensive accusations against every female lawmaker.After Rep. Judy Boyle was named the chair of the House Agriculture Committee , Rep. Heather Scott remarked that Boyle got the position because female lawmakers spread their legs to rise in rank , suggesting that women perform sexual favors to get leadership positions.The incident occurred on December 1st in the House lounge and the remark was said loudly enough that several witnesses heard it.Scott then repeated the remark in the House chamber , not only upsetting female lawmakers , but male lawmakers as well . That s not true , Rep. Stephen Hartgen , told the Spokesman-Review in response to Scott s claim . I ve been here almost 10 years . People get ahead here on the basis of merit , in my humble opinion . I ve never seen anything that would cause me to question that premise . Rep. Christy Perry also blasted Scott s behavior . It s important to me that the public understands that it s absolutely a false allegation that it s not what happens in this building . It s extremely disrespectful . A number of the lady legislators are very upset about this . It s just entirely inappropriate . And the Idaho legislature responded as a whole by stripping Scott of all her committee assignments.According to the Statesman Review , As the House convened today , it moved to the 13th order , and the clerk read the list of committee assignments , listing all members of three committees Commerce , Environment and State Affairs . Missing from all three was the name of Rep.

       " 'It really is perfect.And it s from a book that was published in 1961.When Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 over 50 years ago , he had no idea that a particular passage in his classic novel would one day be the EXACT description of the Republican Party.But Twitter user Maris Kreizman certainly noticed the similarities , which is why she shared the discovery , only for it to then be shared worldwide by singing and acting icon Bette Midler.In a post last month that seems to have gone largely unnoticed for some reason , Midler posted the passage , aiming particularly at Donald Trump . However , the paragraph really can be be applied to the GOP in general . It was miraculous . It was almost no trick at all , he saw , to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth , impotence into abstinence , arrogance into humility , plunder into philanthropy , thievery into honor , blasphemy into wisdom , brutality into patriotism , and sadism into justice . Anybody could do it ; it required no brains at all . It merely required no character . ~Joseph Heller , Catch-22Here s the tweet via Twitter.With credit . pic.twitter.com/8wrCbwEY49 Bette Midler ( @ BetteMidler ) January 4 , 2016For years , Republicans have been hypocrites when it comes to lawbreaking , claiming that it s okay when white conservatives use their guns to seize federal property or use their bibles as an excuse to violate the rights of others . In other words , they want us all to think of these vices as virtues.The slander into truth part is pretty easy since Republicans have been lying about liberals and liberal policies throughout the last eight years while insisting that they are telling the truth.Republicans have also disguised arrogance as humility , although they really aren t hiding it anymore.The way conservative donors like the Koch brothers use pretended philanthropy to give themselves more power is one of the more disgusting aspects of Republicans today , and it was perfectly described by Heller.Republicans have also pretended for decades that stealing from the poor to give to the wealthy is honorable , but it s only caused great suffering among the American people as the middle class shrinks and families struggle to put food on the table.Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it very clear during the GOP primary that they intend to bring back torture , which they think is a patriotic and just way of fighting the war on terror . For years , Republicans have displayed fake patriotism while at the same time sending our troops to their deaths in wars for profit and once our troops come home , they refuse to take care of them . This is evident in their blockage of bills that would aid veterans and first responders.And finally , the conservative support of the death penalty and cops who kill unarmed black men are the ultimate examples of how Republicans see sadism as justice.Make no mistake , this paragraph from Joseph Heller is downright prophetic , and Bette Midler did us all a favor by bringing it to our attention .

       " 'BEIJING - China said on Monday it hopes the Iran nuclear deal will stay intact , playing an important role in keeping the peace , after a senior U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to decertify the agreement . The official , speaking last week on condition of anonymity , said Trump was also expected to roll out a broader U.S. strategy on Iran that would be more confrontational . The Trump administration has frequently criticized Iran s conduct in the Middle East . Trump , who has called the pact an embarrassment and the worst deal ever negotiated , has been weighing whether it serves U.S. security interests as he faces an Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms . Speaking in Beijing , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the Iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks . The agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the Middle East , she added . We hope that the comprehensive Iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented , Hua told a daily news briefing . Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord , under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy . If Trump declines to certify Iran s compliance , U.S. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement . The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact , which was signed by the United States , Britain , France , Germany , Russia , China , the European Union and Iran , has worried some U.S. allies . China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Tehran , and was also instrumental in pushing through the landmark 2015 deal .',\n",

       " 'SEOUL - North Korean hackers stole a large amount of classified military documents , including South Korea-U.S. wartime operational plans to wipe out the North Korean leadership , a South Korean ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday . Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from the Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year , citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials . An investigative team inside the defense ministry announced in May the hack had been carried out by North Korea , but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken . Pyongyang has denied responsibility in its state media for the cyber attacks , criticizing Seoul for fabricating claims about online attacks . Separately on Wednesday , cyber security firm FireEye said in a statement North Korea-affiliated agents were detected attempting to phish U.S. electric companies through emails sent in mid-September , although those attempts did not lead to a disruption in the power supply . It did not specify when the attempts had been detected or clarify which companies had been affected . Rhee , currently a member of the National Assembly s committee for national defense , said about 80 percent of the hacked data had not yet been identified , but that none of the information was expected to have compromised the South Korean military because it was not top classified intelligence . Some of the hacked data addressed how to identify movements of members of the North Korean leadership , how to seal off their hiding locations , and attack from the air before eliminating them . Rhee said the North could not have taken the entire operation plans from the database because they had not been uploaded in full . These plans had likely not been classified properly but defense ministry officials told Rhee the hacked documents were not of top importance , he said . Whatever the North Koreans took , we just need to fix the plans , Rhee later told by telephone . I disclosed this because the military hasn t been doing that fast enough . Rhee said on radio the hack had been made possible by a simple mistake after a connector jack linking the military s intranet to the internet had not been eliminated after maintenance work had been done on the system . The South Korean Defense Ministry s official stance is that they can not confirm anything the lawmaker said about the hacked content due to the sensitivity of the matter . In Washington , the Pentagon said it was aware of the media reports but would not comment on the potential breach . Although I will not comment on intelligence matters or specific incidents related to cyber intrusion , I can assure you that we are confident in the security of our operations plans and our ability to deal with any threat from North Korea , Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters . FireEye said the phishing attack on the electric companies detected was early-stage reconnaissance and did not indicate North Korea was about to stage an imminent , disruptive cyber attack . The North has been suspected of carrying out similar cyber attacks on South Korean electric utilities , in addition to other government and financial institutions . Those attempts were likely aimed at creating a means of deterring potential war or sowing disorder during a time of armed conflict , FireEye said . North Korea linked hackers are among the most prolific nation-state threats , targeting not only the U.S. and South Korea but the global financial system and nations worldwide , its statement said . Their motivations vary from economic enrichment to traditional espionage to sabotage , but all share the hallmark of an ascendant cyber power willing to violate international norms with little regard for potential blowback , it said .',\n",
       " 'Let s just put it this way , if world leaders really agree with Donald Trump they have a lot of explaining to do in their home countries.Because a massive global survey found that only TWO nations think Trump is doing a good job.During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week , Trump voiced his disdain for the United Nations , accusing the organization of being a mismanaged bureaucracy and threatened to pull American financial and military support.Trump also threatened war with North Korea and criticized the Iran nuclear deal while one of his top advisers told climate ministers that Trump is still withdrawing America from the historic Paris climate agreement.Afterwards , Trump took to Twitter to boast about his speech , and claimed that those in attendance agreed with most or all of what he said.A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much ( or all ) of what I stated in my speech ! Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 20 , 2017In fact , Trump received tepid clapping from the General Assembly , not even close to the kind of thunderous applause President Obama received when he spoke before the international peace-keeping body.And a new study of global surveys reveals that most nations in the world have very little confidence in Trump , which means all the world diplomats who supposedly agree with much or all of what Trump said can expect to be replaced . In fact , the only nations who have a favorable view of Trump are Russia and Israel.According to FiveThirtyEight.com , Since Trump took office , confidence in the president has gone down further , on average , than favorability toward the U.S. : Confidence dropped 47 points ; U.S. favorability just 13 points Some of the biggest declines have been in countries with whom the U.S. has a collective defense agreement , such as NATO members and Japan , especially when it comes to confidence in the president Mexico , unsurprisingly , also saw a big public opinion drop on both questions . On the other hand , public favorability toward the U.S. has gone up in Russia , and public confidence in the president has gone up in both Israel and Russia since Trump took office . While President Obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of 63 to 73 percent , Trump only has a rating of 27 percent.One of the largest drops came from South Korea , in which only 17 percent have confidence in Trump . 88 percent had confidence in President Obama just two years ago . Clearly , South Koreans are alarmed by the pissing match Trump is having with Kim Jong-Un to discover who is the craziest dictator of them all . Overall , though , Trump has brought a return to George W. Bush-era levels of favorability for the U.S. and the presidency , FiveThirtyEight concluded.And it turns out that the world disagrees with Trump on most of the issues.Only one nation agreed with Trump s climate change policy . Trump s Mexican border wall was almost universally disliked . His vows to withdraw from trade agreements were just as unpopular . Only Turkey approved of withdrawing from the Iran deal . And only three nations approve of Trump s Muslim ban . Basically , most of Trump s supporters come from nations that have committed human rights violations or have oppressive governments.In short , the world representatives who make up the United Nations General Assembly are more likely repulsed by Trump . Tepid clapping is not the definition of overwhelming agreement . Trump thinks that everyone likes him and agrees with him because he is a delusional narcissist.The reality is that Trump has turned America into an international joke and has harmed our reputation around the globe . He is an embarrassment to our country who should be removed from office immediately before he inflicts more damage.He is now the most hated president in history , and that must make George W. Bush very happy . Featured Image : Ron Sachs Pool/Getty Images',\n",

Podesta stepped down on the same day federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and a business associate , Rick Gates , with money laundering . Manafort , a longtime Republican operative , and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment with charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine ’ s former pro-Russian government . The indictment against Manafort and Gates listed two unnamed firms as “ Company A ” and “ Company B ” that lobbied several lawmakers on behalf of Ukraine at Manafort ’ s request . The indictment did not name Podesta Group . A spokesperson for the Podesta Group said after Podesta stepped down on Monday that it had been in contact with investigators on special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s team and was fully cooperating with the probe . The spokesperson also said the Podesta Group fully complied with the law in disclosing its lobbying on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine , a group linked to Manafort and named in the indictment . Podesta Group filed lobbying disclosures with the Department of Justice in April and August saying it did work in 2012 for the same pro-Russian Ukrainian group for which Manafort had worked . Podesta Group work alongside another Washington lobbying firm , Mercury LLC , which also said on Monday that it was cooperating with Mueller ’ s team .

It did $ 10.7 million in lobbying in the first nine months of 2017 , according to disclosures the firm filed with the U.S. Congress . He is the brother of John Podesta , who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , and as a senior White House adviser to Democratic former President Barack Obama . Mueller ’ s team has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign , but neither Trump nor the campaign were mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates .

       " 'Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireCliven Bundy , the Nevada rancher at the center of the federal standoff in Bunkerville in 2014 , was arrested by FBI agents at around 10pm Wednesday evening as he touched down at Portland International Airport . Bundy , 74 yrs old , of Bunkerville , Nevada , was taken to Oregon s Multnomah County detention center and charged with conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer the same federal felony charge made two weeks ago against of his two sons , Ammon and Ryan Bundy.According to Oregon Live , Cliven Bundy , also faces weapons charges , dating back to the original standoff in April 2014.READ THE FULL FEDERAL COMPLAINT AGAINST CLIVEN BUNDY HERE . Police Mug Shot : Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy was arrested in Portland last night.Bundy s dramatic arrest came as he was planning to meet up with staunch Bundy supporter , Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore , for a Q & A press conference in Portland scheduled for early Thursday morning , presumably to advocate for the Bundy sons and others currently under federal incarceration , and to help mediate a peaceful resolution for the remaining 4 occupiers still held-up at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge outside of Burns , Oregon.The timeline of these events is particularly interesting . Before Cliven Bundy touched down in Portland , Fiore ( photo , left ) had already arrived in town , but was immediately confronted with a breaking situation on Wednesday afternoon , where reports indicate that there were likely dozens of heavily armed federal tactical and state SWAT members positioned at various points around the perimeter of the occupied federal refuge office building . On Wednesday evening , law enforcement appeared to have decided to make their move to end the occupation by re-taking the protest site and remove its occupants . Fiore then headed to Burns while engaged in a 4 hour-long phone call with the protesters live-streamed on YouTube with nearly 60,000 listeners on the call.Clearly , the FBI had plenty of foreknowledge of Cliven Bundy and Michele Fiore s potentially explosive media spectacle scheduled for this morning . FBI agents appear to have preempted this national ( and global ) press event by Bundy and Fiore , quickly moving on the protest , and then taking Cliven Bundy out of the equation , or off the street , as it were . This chain of events over the last 24 hours indicates that the federal government had made decisive moves at key moments in order to temporarily control the media and political narratives , and by extension , the course of events which have followed . That reality was echoed by Portland attorney , Mike Arnold , currently representing Ammon Bundy , who said earlier today : It s terribly unfortunate the timing of his arrest , given all the progress Assemblywoman Fiore made this evening . In addition to Fiore and Cliven Bundy arriving in Oregon this week , Franklin Graham , son of evangelist Billy Graham , posted on Facebook that he had been talking with the four holdouts for a week , at their request and at the request of the FBI , and was said to be heading for Burns to witness a peaceful resolution . Early on Thursday , Graham stated the following : I am on my way there Please keep them , law enforcement officials , and all involved in your prayers , that everyone will be safe . Presently , federal forces are still at the gates of the refuge , with occupiers still inside . According to the Oregonian , the remaining occupiers are 27-year-old David Fry , the man running the refuge protest YouTube livestream , along with married couple Sean and Sandy Anderson , and one other man known by the name of Jeff Banta . It s not completely clear if all the occupants are armed , and there have been some mixed messages over the last two weeks as to what their exact intentions were , and what concessions were possible through negotiations.UPDATE : 4 holdouts all in FBI custody as occupation endsIn an overwhelming show of force , the FBI have surrounded the small one story detached Malheur office building with MRAP armored vehicles and other assets , including multiple surveillance drones positioned overhead . It s not known exactly how many federal agents are in position at the refuge and the surrounding area , but based on similar events , the number could be at least 300 , not including state and other law enforcement agents.At the end of January , a team of federal and state agents shot and killed the protest s spokesman , Arizona rancher , Robert Lavoy Finicum , in what can only be described as a well-organize , federal and state ambush , involving dozens of vehicles and armed agents ( including snipers ) positioned along an isolated rural stretch of Oregon highway 395 . The mainstream media are still disingenuously referring to the event as a traffic stop incident in what appears to be a well-coordinated PR effort to minimize any accusations of over-reach on the part of the federal agencies.The left-wing arm of the media , and a virtual army of anti-Bundy activists online will certainly be celebrating this latest development as a government victory .With the iconic face of the public lands issue , Cliven Bundy , now in custody , this will either stir the burgeoning Constitutionalist movement , or it will further demoralize it.Cliven Bundy is expected to appear in a Portland federal court this afternoon.Watch this space.READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Oregon Files',\n",

Schwarzenegger himself was once in immigrant as many of us were and he added his thoughts about what is truly an unjust , vile way to express hatred and xenophobia.In an interview with Mario Lopez , Schwarzenegger bashed Trump and his administration s incompetent and humiliating rollout of his executive order on immigration , which only led to chaos and public outcry . Schwarzenegger , the former governor of California , stated that Trump s ban was vetted badly and that there is another way to going about it to do it the right way and accomplish all of the goals . I think they were hasty with it . Schwarzenegger then gave his own personal experience of immigrating to the United States in 1968 and shamed Trump for his clumsy delivery . He said : To go and to ban people that have a green card that means that the United States of America has given you permission to work here permanently in this country and you are on the way to permanent citizenship I was in that position It s crazy , it s crazy and makes us look stupid when the White House is ill-prepared to put these kind of executive orders out there . Schwarzenegger said he hoped Trump and his moronic helpers would learn from this incident and use it as a wake-up call .

Kushner is the only current White House official known to be considered a key person in the probe , the newspaper reported . The FBI , several congressional committees and a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department are looking into allegations of meddling by Russia in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties between Trump ’ s presidential campaign and Russian officials seeking to influence the election . The controversy has engulfed Trump ’ s administration since he fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9 . Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies collusion with Russia .

       " 'The NFL is toast They just caved to demands made by players to dump millions into a social justice boondoggle aimed at the black community . The problem is that the entire Black Lives Matter scam is a lie AND PLAYERS KNOW IT . There is now discord between players who feel differently about the kneeling protest . A lack of leadership by Goodell to put an end to the protests , has harmed the NFL irreparably . The NFL is just another social justice program BOYCOTT ! WHAT EXACTLY IS SOCIAL JUSTICE ? The NFL met with a group of players and reached an agreement in principle late Wednesday night to partner on a plan to address social justice issues considered important to African-American communities , sources told ESPN.The unprecedented agreement calls for the league to contribute $ 89 million over seven years to projects dealing with criminal justice reform , law enforcement/community relations and education.During a conference call Wednesday night , Malcolm Jenkins and Anquan Boldin , who lead roughly 40 players who have negotiated with the league office about demonstrations during the national anthem , guided the group through the highlights of the package , which represents the NFL s largest contribution to a social issue , surpassing that of Salute to Service or Breast Cancer Awareness/Crucial Catch.The partnership came a day after some players broke away from the Players Coalition because of their dissatisfaction with how Jenkins and Boldin have handled negotiations . Commissioner Roger Goodell , believing that an agreement was at hand , was furious when ESPN reported that players were breaking off , according to one source . But during an afternoon call , Jenkins asked that the commissioner and the owners continue to stand with the players and allow them to do important work in the community.NO END IN SIGHT FOR PROTESTS : The agreement does not include language calling for players to end protests during the national anthem in exchange for funds ; there s no implicit quid pro quo . But the NFL hopes this effort will effectively end the peaceful yet controversial movement that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started in 2016 , when he refused to stand for the anthem.Via : ESPN',\n",
       " 'Deep inside the archetypal psyche of Pepe the Frog Branko Mali 21st Century WireWhile Richard Spencer s half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with Roman salute rose a lot of dust , some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction . A posthuman one . transcript with references and additional a/v material : Undoubtedly , there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump . If for nothing else , then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears , crying foul over racism , homophobia , xenophobia and whateverphobia ; it was a joy , and a relief , because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger.However , the party is over and the dialectics are back with the vengeance .As SJWs are , hopefully , moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage , the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image.If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn , this image will be just as ugly and just as unreal as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct shitlib .In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right , or Alt Right movement , Richard Spencer , in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun .This is an interesting , and to my mind quite worrisome , statement of intent a manifestation of will , as Spencer would doubtless rectify me pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal and quite unidirectional circular movement of the pagan deity , revered by all self-respecting bermenschen from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists.However , there s a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here . The pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy ( Nietzsche ) in it s virtual , postmodern , installment is not to be strictly represented by a Swastika as Spencer apparently assumes , but by other , only seemingly ancient , symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin ( or his minions ) : an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement.The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement , not of sun , but of presumably primordial origin of everything : Chaos.In the lines to follow , we ll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation : the channeling of chaos principle and adjacent chaos logic through loosely knit alt right movement , taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer s speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21st.Triumph of the will , or hipster Babylon working ? In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right , embodied in the election of Donald Trump , Spencer makes one interesting remark : But even though we always took Trump seriously , there was still a moment of unreality or perhaps too painfully intense reality when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us , that meme magic was real . And though these terms are used half-jokingly , they represent something truly important the victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office , made this dream into reality . We ll start our explanation with lesser weirdness . Meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent , coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology : memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which , by circulation in public , acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages , like viruses . A Meme is inexistent because there s no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses . Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based : what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial . Yet they , quite paradoxically , exist because the analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question , why it works.Well , it works because it is magical , in a manner of speaking.Chaos MagickHere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern in fact , post-humanist vein , resting on the assumption that what has not evolved in nature can and should be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution . If a artificial construct is in line with a principle of evolution it is real or , to be more precise , it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence.Therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial , preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial , preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs.The goal of practitioner of such magic a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic is to change the world according to his will . This is , more or less , what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural domain of the world , in the past mostly confined to people born with the dubious talent to practice it . The peculiarity of chaos magick is , on the one hand , that it is entirely syncretic , i.e . that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended , subjective , meaning , and that it relies on virtual , i.e . artificial world of mass culture , now embodied above all in Internet.The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible.There are many interesting implications to this.The first is that everything is interrelated , i.e . that everything is connected with everything else . So any which way you take , you ll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough . The second is that there s no hierarchy of higher and lower there s only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements , dissolving in turn into nothingness , if concentrated upon . As there s nothing higher , there s nothing to be revered and everything can and indeed : should be an object of ironical laughter . And , most importantly , this is the world of dreams , ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact : chaos logic or un-logic.In this sense , Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump s victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick.In theory , Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality virtual reality , one may add , yet reality nonetheless . The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives from the appeal of his politics , to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks is immaterial , because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel , or interpretation of the world , is as real as any other.In this sense we can observe the new God Emperor of USA as a magical creation of Internet , by the Internet and for the Internet today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes , but soon probably the Internet of Things.If one is to push Spencer s remark to it s logical extreme , we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world s first president of posthuman race ; an embodiment of a ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group.So that was lesser weirdness . Let us proceed now to high weirdness.Hail Kek ! We owe the reader an answer to a question : who the hell is Kek ? Well , the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal half-joke : Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar Pepe the Frog . While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian , because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts , I consider this interpretation , upon closer inspection , to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic.Namely , Pepe , the cartoon character , conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie , emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums , more precisely : 4chan sub-forum/pol/ , devoted to political discussions with no holds barred , which was , in view of some observers , a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados ; a place of absolute freedom , therefore : absolute chaos.The expression Kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation LOL ( laughing out loud ) . Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity , signifying Chaos and darkness , and Pepe was then rebranded as Kek the deity an ironic one , no doubt , half joking one , as surprisingly many alt-righters like to put it , but deity nonetheless.It is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric Kekists , that is : ( half grinning ) faithful of Kek/Pepe , the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental , yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities causally unrelated meaningful relations among events . So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to cuck ( originally : cuckservative ) , a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled ( another meme taken from pop culture , shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists ) by alt right or , should we assume : Kek himself ; furthermore , Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy , identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character . Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras , and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek . A good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification.However , it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum : One last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture : dubs.Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp . This number represents that post s entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard.With the amount of traffic these sites get , the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll . When a poster gets repeated digits , its called dubs , trips , quads , and so on.Since a poster can t know their post number until after they ve submitted the post , its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits ( ) When that endeavor proves a successful , a GET has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated.Out of this practice , a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/ : discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs . It wasn t long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture : and a god was born . ( source ) Synchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign , are so numerous and , frankly , mind boggling that we can not list them here , for the sake of brevity . For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados , including core leadership , Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet , all declared with smug grin and ironical stance , yet with all the necessary power of conviction.Namely , chaos magick relies on laughter , or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled . Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world as Spencer would put it : make his dreams a reality.I would go further and add : make all reality a dream ; because , chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual , i.e . posthuman , world . The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism in its essence , however , it is a complete opposite : a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being into nothingness of primordial Chaos.Posthuman traditionalismI already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin , who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age , but now we can see how his affiliates in the USA and Europe are doing the same thing with less philosophical subtlety , but fueled by much greater raw power . Namely , alt right , if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates , is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition something Richard Spencer likes to call political theology founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality , all done in the virtual ether of information technology . After all , if we are to agree with Spencer half jokingly of course that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God , then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic ; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics.In the end , therefore , we are talking about another victory of posthumanism , branded , spontaneously or otherwise , as traditionalism . The obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend : they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various , rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard , from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic and to a large extent made up pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator , save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-Darwinist stance , especially to be found among game bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind actually the only one there is while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males , sexual market , signaling and counter-signaling , professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes , genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends.The allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West , induced by process of globalization . Yet this is an eristic or , to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine : discordian dialectic ; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos . It is all done with the crooked half grin , a pinch of salt to every smug remark with irony of the man who knows he s a liar and a cheat . But smug humor goes just a short way . In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend , far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for.We ll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right . The words have a definite meanings and power . There s only one Chaos and there s only one bringer of light from Chaos as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog s main job . And it s not the One to be defined as God from God , Light from Light , but God from Gutter , Light from Darkness . A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness . Hope you guess His name.So , without a pinch of irony , I declare : be careful who your hail . * * * Author Branko Mali is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune , with the background in classical philosophy .

       " 'The presumed nomination of Donald Trump has given a new flavor to the 2016 GOP field . Or , perhaps I should say that the presumed nomination of Trump has given new courage to people who have spent far too many years ( in their opinions ) hiding their racist views.Carlos Beruff , who is running for Marco Rubio s Senate seat in Florida , is one of those previously silenced people whose racist views have been liberated by the Trump campaign , and he let his racist flag fly high at a St. Johns County GOP meeting on Thursday . His favorite nickname for the President ? Animal . Unfortunately , for seven and a half years this animal we call president , because he s an animal , OK seven and a half years , has surgically and with thought and very smart , intelligent manner , destroyed this country and dismantled the military under not one , not two , but three secretary of defenses , he said . And they ve all written books about it . Sooner or later , you re going to find , this was a plan , he wants us to be just another country . I don t want to be another country . I want to be the United States of America , the greatest country in the world , he added , garnering a round of applause.Here s the video : Beruff has more than racism in common with Trump . Like Trump , he s a successful land developer and like Trump , he sees the government as standing in the way of him and more riches . If he was to be elected , there would be conflicts of interest from every direction : Today he s one of the wealthiest developers in Southwest Florida , building more than 2,500 homes in three different counties . And as his business grew , so did his political influence fueled by campaign contributions to then Florida Governor Charlie Crist . Crist appointed him to three civic boards . The Southwest Florida Water Management district , the State College of Florida , the Manatee-Sarasota Airport Authority.In 2010 Beruff then shifted his allegiance to Governor Rick Scott , who appointed him to his health panel and reappointed him to positions already held.His role as developer has been no less controversial . For example , Long Bar Pointe , a 500-acre development that environmentalists say could cause irreparable damage to the shoreline.More than 6,500 opponents signed a petition against the Long Bar Pointe development . Ultimately , the county voted Beruff s proposal down and now Beruff is suing the county government for its actions.Source : My Sun CoastBeruff , though , is even more extreme than Trump . He wants to ban not just Muslims , but all immigration from the Middle East . That would even include the Christians who are being persecuted by ISIS.Fortunately for Floridians and the nation , Beruff is unlikely to win . Right now , he s at one percent.Featured image via Carlos Beruff Facebook page .',\n",
       " '- The New York Power Authority ( NYPA ) on Friday sent 10 engineers , planners and technical supervisors to Puerto Rico to help with the assessment and reconstruction of the island s power grid , which was completely shut down by Hurricane Maria . The NYPA workers were part of a group that traveled to Puerto Rico with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on the first flight to depart for Puerto Rico s capital San Juan since the Category 4 hurricane hit the island on Wednesday , according to a statement from the governor s office . We have assembled top emergency response experts to support Puerto Rico and help repair its devastated power structure , and we are providing supplies and any additional assistance we can to support the island as they recover from this unprecedented natural disaster , Cuomo said in a statement . In addition to the 10 NYPA specialists and translators , New York also sent drones and two drone pilots from the Department of Environmental Conservation to assist with the reconstruction of Puerto Rico s power grid . The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ) , which owns and operates the power system serving the commonwealth s 3.4 million residents , filed for bankruptcy in July , after years of underinvestment that yielded a grid it called degraded and unsafe . Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has said PREPA was so severely hit that it could be months before electricity is restored to all customers . The NYPA workers are some of the first utility workers to go to Puerto Rico from the mainland after Maria . The American Public Power Association ( APPA ) , which is helping coordinate the utility response , has said it was also planning to bring in crews from other parts of the U.S. mainland to help with recovery efforts on both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands . There were some specialists from the Western Area Power Authority , which serves much of the U.S. West from Montana to Texas and California , already on Puerto Rico when Maria struck the island . The Western Area workers had been on their way to the Virgin Islands to help rebuild and restore power after Hurricane Irma when they got stuck in Puerto Rico . Irma grazed Puerto Rico on Sept. 6 , knocking out power to more than 1 million of PREPA s 1.5 million customers . PREPA said it restored power to all but about 60,000 homes and businesses by Tuesday before Maria hit .',\n",
       " 'DUBAI - Saudi authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested 22 people , including a Qatari national , for using social media to spread dissent . Another 24 people were detained in the northern Hail region for stirring tribal divisions , the state news agency SPA reported . Neither report went into the details of the offenses . The announcements came days after a order from King Salman lifting a ban on women driving in the conservative Islamic kingdom . Saudi Arabia , alongside the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain and Egypt , has also cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar accusing it of supporting militants and Iran - charges Doha denies . Citing a source in the newly-created Presidency of State Security , the counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence body , SPA said the 22 had been detained after authorities spotted videos on social media inciting against public order . The online postings stirred up feelings towards issues that are still under consideration , and incited people to commit crimes , SPA said . Separately , SPA carried a statement from the interior ministry saying that during unspecified investigations in Hail , people linked to the case were promoting lies and exaggerations about their circumstances in order to provoke sedition and tribal tensions . Soon after the two reports , Saudi Arabia s top clerical body , the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars , issued a statement saying : Anyone who tried to harm the kingdom security and the unity of its people has committed a dangerous crime .',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump sure knows how to pick his surrogates . They seem to be just as deluded and self-centered as he is . In the midst of the world economy facing catastrophic consequences as the United Kingdom votes to exit the European Union , one of Trump s supporters , Wayne Allyn Root , went on television and took credit for the economic crisis.Now most people would not want to take credit for such a thing , but this is a Trump supporter we are talking about here . Appearing on Fox News on Sunday , Root said to the hosts of Fox and Friends : I wouldn t be surprised if in the last week they ve lost some business . And I m sure it s going to build as the word gets out as we get to the convention and people hear about this terrible , terrible business decision biased business decision , I think a reckless business decision . And I know that after the Brexit on Friday , Apple stock is very close to their 52-week low . So whether it was me or whether it was word getting out from others or whether it was the Brexit , I know Apple stock isn t doing to good either.Have some patience , I think Apple is going to feel it in the pocketbook eventually . This all comes with Apple s decision to pull out of donating technical supplies and money to the Republican National Convention , all because of controversial presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump . Yes , you read that right . Wayne Allyn Root believes that his feeble campaign against Apple has the power to have this kind of effect on the Global economy . Good luck with that , sir.Even one of the hosts on Fox , Clayton Morris , reminded Root that the folks at Apple likely saw the disassociation from the RNC in the wake of Trump s nomination as a good business decision . Root was undeterred , though , and pressed on : As the CEO you can make a personal decision , but you have no right to make a business decision and offend half your customers . Morris also pointed to the fact that Apple has made no comments on the Democratic National Convention , either : We have no word from Apple if they are not going to donate stuff to the DNC also . So , we still don t know the other half of this story . But as you can tell , we have a lot to say about it.The only thing that I know is that this Brexit was all tied into what we re talking about . I think that people all over the world are getting sick of big companies , big corporations and big media and big government all being tied together and making decisions that hurt the people.I think Apple s tied to it . I think the United States government , Obama [ is ] tied to it . I think Brexit s tied to it . I think it s time for Trexit , which is Donald Trump . So , in other words , this Trump supporting loon s rants were too much even for Fox and Friends , which is definitely saying something . Time for your medication , Mr. Root . If you think you re more powerful than Brexit and that your sorry boycott of Apple along with nationally televised rants like this are actually helping your candidate , you are sorely mistaken . Sane people don t listen to crazy people and take them seriously.Watch the lunacy unfold below , via Raw Story : Featured image via video screen capture',\n",

       " \"MOSCOW - A colleague of Katerina Tikhonova from the world of acrobatic rock n roll confirmed that she is the younger daughter of Russian President Vladimir Putin , and then later withdrew his comments , saying he had misheard the question . It is the second time in two years that has disclosed Tikhonova s relationship to the president , citing a named source , and then been publicly challenged post publication . World Rock n Roll Confederation ( WRRC ) Vice President for Legal Affairs Manfred Mohab told in an interview on Sunday during a dance event that he knew Tikhonova through their work together on the confederation s presidium . When asked whether he knew Tikhonova was Putin s daughter , he said : Yes . I know her , yes of course . Asked a second time , he nodded and said : Yes . The Kremlin and Tikhonova did not respond to requests for comment . After the article was published on Tuesday , Mohab telephoned and said : I can t confirm that I know the daughter of Mr. Putin . I have nothing to do with them . Asked why he had earlier said Tikhonova was Putin s daughter , Mohab said : Believe me , it was so loud in the hall that a lot of the things I can t understand and other things I felt that I didn t understand right . So it s not sure that I gave you the right answers . Mohab said he had problems with his hearing . I m sure we had some misunderstandings . In 2015 , Andrey Akimov , deputy chairman of the board of directors at Russian lender Gazprombank , told that Tikhonova was Putin 's daughter but later denied the statement . also confirmed her identity through two other sources who spoke on condition of anonymity . [ reut.rs/2ztup0f ] After the report , Gazprombank said Akimov was `` surprised and bewildered '' by the quotes attributed to him by and that he had made no such remarks . [ reut.rs/2zHzVAJ ] Akimov and a representative for Gazprombank did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday . Putin , a former KGB intelligence officer , is famously guarded about his private life and has fought to keep his two daughters , Maria and Katerina , away from the public eye . While Katerina s identity has been widely assumed , it has never been confirmed by Tikhonova herself , her representatives or the Kremlin , which says it does not comment on the private lives of Putin s close relatives . Mohab , in his comments to on Sunday , became the first official to publicly identify her relationship to the Russian president since Akimov in 2015 . Tikhonova , who uses a surname inherited from her grandmother , runs publicly-funded projects at Moscow State University and serves as the WRRC s vice president for expansion and marketing . Aged 31 , she is a major player in acrobatic rock n roll , a niche dance discipline she has competed in and helps manage through senior positions at the WRRC and the Russian national federation . She is also married to Kirill Shamalov , the son of one of Putin 's closest friends , who has since made a fortune of at least $ 1 billion through dealings in Russia 's largest petrochemical company . [ reut.rs/2BfT74A ] Mohab spoke to on the sidelines of the World Cup Rock n Roll European Championship in Moscow . Asked if Tikhonova s personal connection to the president had been a boon for acrobatic rock n roll , he said : Yes , of course . The sport is developing thanks to Russia , he said . We have an expansion project which is working on all continents and in a lot of countries . And this is all going out from Russia . With just over 200 adult pairs in the WRRC world rankings , acrobatic rock n roll remains a relatively obscure discipline in competitive dancing that is most popular in eastern Europe . Around 9,000 people actively participate in acrobatic rock n roll in Russia and organizers aim to add another 3,000 people by 2020 , according to the national federation . reported in December last year that Moscow was building a publicly-funded $ 30 million complex for the sport on the outskirts of the city , an investment which dwarfs that spent in other countries and on some bigger sports in Russia .\",\n",
       " 'Georgia risks losing a chance to host the Super Bowl if an anti-gay bill currently working its way through the state legislature becomes law . The National Football League has issued a statement on Georgia s so-called religious freedom legislation , House Bill 757 . NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness , and prohibit discrimination based on age , gender , race , religion , sexual orientation , or any other improper standard , NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement . Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites . The Falcons are currently building a new stadium in Atlanta , which is slated to open in 2017 . They were hoping to host a Super Bowl there in either 2019 or 2020 . The league has often given new stadiums , particularly in warmer climates , an opportunity to host the championship game.The law in question would allow faith-based groups to refuse service to people if that service violated the group s religious beliefs . That has re-ignited fears of discrimination against LGBT Americans enshrined in the law . This would allow organizations to discriminate against LGBT people or single mothers who have no ministerial function within the religious organization , like a janitor , a cafeteria worker , an administrative assistant , said Anthony Kreis , a professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in constitutional law.Arthur Blank , co-founder of Home Depot and owner of the Falcons , opposes the bill . He said it would have long-lasting negative impact on our state and the people of Georgia . Like what happened in Indiana , hundreds of business leaders oppose Georgia s religious freedom law , which now awaits the signature of Governor Nathan Deal , a Republican , to become the law . Deal had previously said he would not sign a bill that allows discrimination . Featured image via Flickr',\n",
       " 'DJIBOUTI - The United States is closely watching a recent increase in piracy off the coast of Somalia , a senior U.S. military official said on Sunday as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited an important military base in Djibouti . The rise in piracy attacks has at least partially been driven by famine and drought in the region , the top U.S. military commander overseeing troops in Africa said during Mattis ’ visit as part of a week-long trip to the Middle East and Africa . The United States uses the base in Djibouti , a tiny country the size of Wales at the southern entrance to the Red Sea , as a launch pad for operations in Yemen and Somalia . The sudden string of attacks by Somali pirates comes after years without a reported incident . Attacks peaked with 237 in 2011 but then declined steeply after ship owners improved security measures and international naval forces stepped up patrols . This month has seen a new rash of attacks , with two ships captured and a third rescued by Indian and Chinese forces after the crew radioed for help and locked themselves in a safe room . “ The bottom line is there have been a half dozen or so ( incidents ) , ” Marine General Thomas Waldhauser said at a press conference standing alongside Mattis . “ We ’ re not ready to say there is a trend there yet but we ’ ll continue to watch , ” he said , adding one reason for the increase was famine and droughts in the region since some vessels targeted were carrying food and oil . According to the U.N. World Food Programme more than 20 million people from Nigeria , Somalia , South Sudan and Yemen are at risk of dying from starvation within the next six months . In South Sudan alone , more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine with a further million on the brink of starvation . Mattis added that while the situation was being watched , he did not expect a U.S. military response to the surge in piracy . A U.S. defense official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said international shipping companies had started to become complacent about their security , which could also help explain the rise in piracy incidents . Djibouti is strategically important as it is on the route to the Suez Canal . The barren nation , sandwiched between Ethiopia , Eritrea and Somalia , also hosts Japanese and French bases . The U.S. base , which has about 4,000 personnel , is located just miles from a Chinese one , still under construction , which has caused concern to some U.S. officials . Mattis ’ visit to the base comes as the United States has been increasing pressure on militant groups such as al Shabaab in the region . The White House recently granted the U.S. military broader authority to strike al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants in Somalia . Waldhauser told reporters that he had not yet used the new authorities given to him by the White House . Al Shabaab has been able to carry out deadly bombings despite losing most of its territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the Somali government . On Sunday , a military vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Somalia ’ s semi autonomous Puntland region on Sunday , killing at least six soldiers and injuring another eight . The United States recently sent a few dozen troops to Somalia to help train members of the Somali National Army . It is also carrying out strikes in Yemen against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) . AQAP boasts one of the world ’ s most feared bomb makers , Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri , and it has been a persistent concern to the U.S. government ever since a 2009 attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day .',\n",
       " 'UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON - Seven U.S. women senators urged President Barack Obama on Thursday to push for the election of the United Nations ’ first female secretary-general later this year . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , a former South Korean foreign minister , is due to step down at the end of 2016 after two five-year terms . A man has held the top job at the world organization since its inception 70 years ago . The 15-member Security Council , including veto powers China , Russia , the United States , Britain and France , will recommend a candidate for election by the 193-member General Assembly to succeed Ban . “ We ask that the United States play a leading role in pressing for the strong consideration of qualified women , ” the seven Democratic senators wrote to Obama . Led by Barbara Boxer , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the letter was also signed by senators Patty Murray , Mazie Hirono , Tammy Baldwin , Kirsten Gillibrand , Jeanne Shaheen and Barbara Mikulski . In response to the senators ’ letter , a senior Obama administration official said : “ While we would welcome the selection of a woman as the next Secretary-General , we will ultimately support the best candidate of either gender. ” Fifty-three 53 countries , led by Colombia , are pushing for a female secretary-general . Several civil society groups are also lobbying for a woman to lead the organization . Seven candidates have been put forward , including three women : U.N. cultural organization ( UNESCO ) Director-General Irina Bokova , former Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic and Moldova ’ s former Foreign Minister Natalia Gherman . The other four candidates are former Macedonian Foreign Minister Srgjan Kerim , Montenegro Foreign Minister Igor Luksic , former Slovenian President Danilo Turk and former U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres . “ I would say Guterres has got the better chance of all of those who have entered the race , but I still don ’ t think the winning candidate has entered yet , ” a senior Security Council diplomat said on condition of anonymity . Diplomats said other potential female candidates included Helen Clark , former New Zealand prime minister and head of the U.N. Development Programme ; Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra ; and European Union Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources Kristalina Georgieva . The U.N. top job traditionally rotates between regions , with Eastern Europe next on the list . “ While the U.N. has upheld the consideration of regional rotation , it has not given full consideration to gender equality , ” the U.S. senators wrote . A U.S. congressional aide said other female senators , including Republicans , were approached to back the letter to Obama , but none had yet signed on . Most Republicans see many of the U.N. ’ s actions as attempts to improperly influence U.S. policy .',\n",

The media s double standard for our Organizer In Chief compared to the criticism of GW Bush is beyond the pale President Barack Obama declared Louisiana was in a state of disaster on Sunday after a historic flood left at least five people dead , with emergency crews working to rescue thousands more . Governor John Bel Edwards said more than 10,000 people are now in shelters and more than 20,000 people have been rescued across south Louisiana.More than a foot of rain fell overnight on Friday in a deluge estimated to occur once every 500 years , according to the Pacific Standard.In shocking photos showing the devastation , caskets that had washed up from a graveyard floated down the street in Denham Springs , Louisiana.Four people have been reported dead , said Devin George , the state registrar for vital records , earlier Sunday.A woman s body was later recovered by divers from inside a flooded vehicle in East Baton Rouge Parish , appearing to raise the death toll to five.Witnesses said the woman was seen Saturday night attempting to turn around in high water when her vehicle was swept away , said Casey Rayborn Hicks , a spokeswoman for the sheriff s office.In one dramatic rescue Saturday , two men on a boat pulled a woman from a car that was almost completely underwater , according to video by WAFB.Watch video of dramatic rescue HERE.The woman , who s not initially visible on camera , yells from inside the car : Oh my god , I m drowning .

       " 'The GOP didn t panic when a poll conducted earlier this year showed that Utah might vote for the Democratic candidate in November in order to avoid electing Donald Trump . However , they might want to start showing a little concern now , because two new polls show something similar for two more strongly red states . Arizona and Georgia , which tend to vote red in presidential elections , are showing signs that they , too , would turn blue before they d vote for Trump.Donald Trump has long claimed that he s going to win states that typically vote blue in presidential elections , which would rewrite the electoral map , at least for 2016 . Georgia and Arizona , however , don t like his misogynistic statements about women or his racist , hardline comments and unworkable policies against immigrants ( Utah just plain can t stand him ) .So can he rewrite the electoral map ? Sure , but not necessarily in his favor . In Georgia , Trump leads Hillary by just four points , which is within that poll s margin of error . In other words , they re in a statistical tie there . Georgia has voted Republican in every presidential election for the last 20 years , but they re making themselves into an example of the disdain many feel for Trump s fitness to lead a nation.Over in Arizona , Trump leads Hillary by just two points , influenced by a huge Never Trump movement among Republicans there . If Trump can unite the party , he ll probably win Arizona , but for now , it s not looking good for him ( and it s looking just terrible for John McCain in the Senate , too . The horror ) .Trump and his campaign think that his appeal among white , blue collar workers are what will put traditionally blue states back into play for Republicans , creating a ton of new swing states that haven t existed for a long time.They re totally ignoring the fact that this goes both ways , though they ve already made three red states look at the color blue with new appreciation . Some Republican strategists are pointing out that his polarizing rhetoric , which is alienating women and minorities , will make him struggle in a lot more Republican states.In fact , there is really only one way he ll gather enough electoral votes to win the White House . Hillary has a much wider path than our dear Mr. Trump has.It s not likely that Arizona and Georgia , to say nothing of Utah , will be the only three of these states to start leaning away from Trump . Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell said : With Donald Trump , I think he ll have the ability to turn some working class , blue-collar Democrats the so-called Reagan Democrats he ll have the ability to get them to switch over . The question is , are there Republican moderates that will switch over to Secretary Clinton or Bernie Sanders ? For every one blue collar worker that Donald Trump picks up , he has the potential to lose one or more suburban Republican moderate to come over and vote for our side . There are actually a lot of those moderates who won t vote for Trump , as noted above . Arizona and Georgia are now key states , along with Utah and many others . Trump might be crowing over his success in states that have lost a high number of manufacturing jobs , but other states have other issues , and all he s proving is he might not rewrite the electoral map so much as partially invert it , giving even more states to the Democrats than usual.Featured image by Mark Lyons/Stringer/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'As Republicans gather for the first day of their clown show also known as their convention a glaring and telling detail rests in the GOP platform : the preservation of Citizens United and big money in our national politics.On the other side , however , Democrats are committed to overturning the disastrous Supreme Court decision that has allowed a total pollution of our system of politics . And the party s nominee for President of the United States , Hillary Clinton , is making it priority number one.In a video posted at the progressive gathering Netroots Nation in St. Louis , Missouri , Clinton pledged her support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the 2010 decision , and will push for such an amendment in her first 30 days should she be elected.The former secretary also promised to enact an executive order that would require all government contractors to disclose their campaign contributions and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to require all publicly traded companies to disclose their contributions as well.The chances of a constitutional amendment overrunning Citizens United are slim should the House and the Senate remain Republican controlled . But polls show the public overwhelmingly wants money out of politics . Then again , the overwhelming majority of the public supports common sense gun legislation but that hasn t convinced the Republicans to do anything.One of the biggest arguments in the Democratic Primary was the use of money in politics . While both candidates , including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , supported a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United , it was Clinton who received major backlash from progressives over hefty Super PAC contributions . CBS reported last month that her biggest PAC contributor , Priorities USA , had raised over $ 52 million in June alone , and currently has $ 150 million stashed away for general ads against Donald Trump.According to OpenSecrets , an independent government watchdog group , of the $ 314 million that Clinton has raised this election season , 27 percent of that came from Super PAC donations.The bottom line is this : yes , Hillary Clinton used Super PAC money to help fund her campaign and get this far in a very competitive race . But in the age of Super PACs ( and now a billionaire mogul ) , a candidate needs money to win . Clinton recognizes this , and is pledging to put an end to the system that pollutes our elections.If anyone thinks a President Trump would end Super PACs , they are blissfully ignorant or totally blind . Or both.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday for new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election , and to force President Donald Trump to get Congress ’ approval before easing any existing sanctions . The vote was 97 to two for the legislation , filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill . It is intended to punish Russia over issues including alleged meddling in the election , annexation of Ukraine ’ s Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country ’ s six-year-long civil war . The measure sets up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions , puts into law actions previously established via presidential executive order , imposes new sanctions on Russians found guilty of human rights abuses or conducting cyber attacks . [ nL1N1JA056 ] It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia , and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Trump , and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election . Moscow denies any such activity , which Trump has dismissed as sour grapes by the Democrats he defeated . The Iran bill , including the Russia sanctions amendment , was expected to pass the Senate on Thursday or later on Wednesday . To take effect , the measure would also have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump . If Trump objected , some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto . “ Today the Senate has finally confronted Russia for interfering in our elections . This bipartisan amendment is the sanctions regime that the Kremlin deserves for its actions , ” said Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen , a leader of the push for the legislation . The only two “ no ” votes on the Russia bill were from Republican Senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul .',\n",
       " 'After being embarrassed on live television Saturday night when John Dickerson fact-checked his lie about Supreme Court history , Ted Cruz showed no shame as he repeated the same line on Sunday.The GOP Debate started off on Saturday night with Dickerson asked Cruz about whether or not President Obama should be able to name a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , who died earlier that day.Cruz claimed that a Supreme Court nominee named by a lame duck president has not been confirmed by the Senate in 80 years . Dickerson , however , pointed out that former President Ronald Reagan s nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy to the bench in 1987 was confirmed by the Senate in 1988 , the final year of Reagan s presidency . Thus , Dickerson caught Cruz lying , which stunned the candidate into silence as the crowd booed the moderator for bringing up pesky facts.During an appearance on ABC s This Week , the Texas Senator told George Stephanopoulos the very same lie and then blamed Democrats as the reason why Kennedy was only confirmed in 1988 , claiming that it would never have happened if they had just automatically confirmed universally despised nominee Robert Bork instead of rejecting him and his extremism . George , the Senate has not confirmed a nominee that was named in the final year , an election year , in 80 years . This is a lame duck president . And , by the way , the only reason Anthony Kennedy was nominated that late is that Democrats in the Senate had gone after and defeated two previous nominees , Robert Bork , which set a new standard for partisan attacks on a nominee , and Doug Ginsburg . So it was the Democrats that had dragged it out for many months to make it that late . And right now , the court is exquisitely balanced . The fact is , however , that there is a process to Supreme Court nominations and confirmations . Many presidents have had their nominees rejected by the Senate , so it s not like Reagan was the first to have a nominee fail to be confirmed . The bottom line is that Cruz is still wrong on his Supreme Court history.But Cruz wasn t done . Upon being asked if he would filibuster anyone President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat , Cruz replied Absolutely , and said that the people should decide who fills the seat by electing the next president . This should be a decision for the people , George . We ve got an election . And , you know , Democrats I can not wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton or with Bernie Sanders and take the case to the people , what vision of the Supreme Court do you want ? Let the election decide it . If the Democrats want to replace this nominee , they need to win the election . Here s the video via ABC . ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosThis is a particularly hard argument to make since Americans elected President Obama for a full four year second term in 2012 by five million votes . President Obama has nearly a full year left in office , so it is absolutely absurd , not to mention an admission that Republican will refuse to do their constitutional duty , to suggest that President Obama should force America to wait a full year or more before the Supreme Court is functioning with a full nine member bench again . President Obama earned the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice when he won the 2012 Election . Ted Cruz and his Republican comrades need to get over it and do their damn jobs .

       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. lawmakers are looking to use a defense policy bill to increase restrictions on military aid for Pakistan , expressing frustration with what they see as Islamabad ’ s failure to crack down on Afghanistan ’ s militant Haqqani network . The $ 602 billion National Defense Authorization Act , or NDAA , passed by the House of Representatives late on Wednesday would block $ 450 million in aid to Islamabad unless it does more to fight the network , which lawmakers see as a major threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan . The bill requires the Pentagon to certify that Pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the Haqqani network , not letting the network use North Waziristan as a safe haven and actively coordinating with Afghanistan ’ s government to fight the network along their border . As they finalized the 2017 version of the annual bill , House members added three amendments related to Pakistan . All passed by unanimous voice vote . One added a fourth requirement to the release of the aid , that the administration certify Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani network senior leaders and mid-level operatives . Another required that the Secretary of Defense certify Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups . And a third added a “ sense of Congress ” that Shakil Afridi is an international hero and calls for his immediate release from prison . Afridi is a Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden . Pakistan sentenced Afridi in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to a militant group , which he denies . That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge . Pakistan says its courts will decide Afridi ’ s fate , and has angrily criticized U.S. politicians , including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , over calls to release him . The House version of the NDAA is not the final version of the legislation . It must be combined with a Senate bill before being sent to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign , or veto . However , there is also strong criticism of Pakistan in the Senate . This month , Senator Bob Corker used his authority as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to bar the use of any U.S. funds for Pakistan to buy American F-16 fighter jets .',\n",

As many as 5,000 trained jihadis are believed to be living freely in Europe today , according to the head of the European Union s policing agency Europol.Agency head Ron Wainwright said between 3,000 and 5,000 jihadis who have trained with the Islamic State ( ISIS/ISIL ) in the Middle East have been able to slip back into Europe .

We can expect [ ISIS ] or other religious terror groups to stage an attack somewhere in Europe with the aim of achieving mass casualties among the civilian population . However , Wainwright said reports that the Islamic State is using the refugee/migrant crisis to sneak jihadis into Europe have been exaggerated . There is no concrete evidence terrorists are systematically using the flow of refugees to infiltrate Europe , he commented.Meanwhile , in Hungary , police reported an increasing number of migrants have been able to circumvent the four-meter , barbed-wire fence to enter the country illegally . In January , 550 people were caught trying to pass the fence compared to 270 in December .

       " 'WASHINGTON - Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , President-elect Donald Trump ’ s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency , said on Wednesday he would honor the intent of the U.S. biofuels program , but remained open to tweaking it . The Renewable Fuel Standard requires the EPA set annual quotas for the use of ethanol and biodiesel in transportation fuels . More than a decade old , the standard is fiercely defended by the U.S. corn industry that provides most of the ethanol , but it has been a source of frustration for oil refiners . They say the goals are unrealistic without an overhaul in automobiles and infrastructure , and are calling for changes . Pruitt said during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that he was committed to Congress ’ plan , laid out in 2007 , to annually increase the amount of ethanol and other renewables blended with petroleum fuels . He said the waivers that EPA has already used to set requirements below those targets to accommodate market conditions should be used “ judiciously ” . He explained his view that the EPA should not use those waivers to “ undermine commitments ” from Congress but that they are needed in some cases , including when there is lower-than-expected fuel demand . The comments quelled some concerns from within the industry over the nominee , who as Oklahoma ’ s attorney general had described the program as “ flawed ” and “ unworkable. ” Renewable Fuels Association Chief Executive Officer and President Bob Dinneen described Pruitt ’ s comments as “ heartening ” in a statement . While generally supportive of program , Pruitt said it was too soon to say whether it needed to be altered . Oil refiners including HollyFrontier Corp and Delta Air Lines Inc ’ s Monroe Energy have requested that the responsibility of blending renewables like ethanol into their fuel be shifted from them to companies further down the supply chain . The EPA moved to deny the request , but is seeking public comment on the decision . When asked about the idea , Pruitt said he did not want to “ pre-judge ” the outcome of the comment period . Trump has separately tapped billionaire and RFS critic Carl Icahn as a special advisor on regulations , raising industry speculation that the incoming administration will be more likely to consider the change . Pruitt is one of several of Trump ’ s senior Cabinet picks to face Senate hearings since last week .',\n",

In those hardest hit by crises Syria , Yemen , Iraq , Libya and Sudan an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished , the U.N. s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security . A quarter of Yemen s people are on the brink of famine , several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times . The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000 . It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict , such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt , had slowly improved in the last decade . But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries . The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition , the FAO s assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said . Decisive steps towards peace and stability ( need to be ) taken .

       " 'ALBANY , N.Y. - New York lawmakers on Monday passed an emergency spending plan authorizing Governor Andrew Cuomo to pay bills and keep the state government operating for the next two months . The state was supposed to have a budget at the start of its fiscal 2018 on Saturday , but the legislature and Cuomo failed to agree on a comprehensive plan as they debated broader policies . Monday ’ s stopgap , 1,700-page “ extender budget ” avoids a government shutdown through May 31 , assuring that state agencies and contractors will provide services and roughly 200,000 state employees will get paid despite the impasse . The full budget has been delayed in part by debate over raising the age of adult criminal responsibility to 18 , which would leave North Carolina as the only state to automatically prosecute and imprison 16- and 17-year-olds as adults regardless of the crime . “ There are political and ideological differences between the Senate and Assembly . We must resolve these issues . A complete budget requires it , ” Cuomo , who supports lifting the age , said in a statement late on Sunday . Lawmakers and Cuomo have been divided over other issues , including a replacement for an expired program that gives tax breaks to affordable housing developers and extending a so-called millionaire ’ s tax on wealthy New Yorkers . Cuomo also laid some blame on uncertainty about Washington ’ s policies , including any revised effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act , which could strip New York of at least $ 4.6 billion of Medicaid and other funding . “ New York State is a target for hostile federal actions ranging from severe financial cutbacks to deprivation of legal and personal rights , ” said Cuomo , a Democrat who is widely touted as a possible 2020 presidential candidate . Assembly member Fred Thiele Jr. , an Independent who caucuses with Democrats , was one of several lawmakers to criticize the inclusion of policy initiatives in the budget legislation , saying from the legislative floor during voting on the bill that “ we are not the platform committee for Cuomo 2020. ” “ They should not be forced down the throat of the legislature as part of the budget process , ” Thiele said during the session . “ The national stage is watching , ” said Assemblymember Diana Richardson , a Democrat from Brooklyn , who voted against the extension . The budget extension authorizes $ 40 billion in state spending , including $ 10.3 billion in state appropriations , $ 12.4 billion aid to local governments and $ 17.3 billion in capital projects . Lawmakers want to get the budget done this week . Whenever it arrives , it will be by far the latest budget since Cuomo took office in 2011 . The Republican-led Senate and Democrat-dominated Assembly endorsed the extension overwhelmingly , but many said they did so reluctantly to avoid a government shutdown . Some were sour on the length of the extension or that it allows for $ 8.9 billion in new debt over the next two months . The measure authorizes billions of dollars in bond financing for bridges and infrastructure projects . Cuomo and lawmakers are also close to a deal on plans to allow car-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber outside New York City , where they are already permitted , Assemblymember Kevin Cahill , a Democrat from Kingston who chairs the Assembly Insurance Committee , said in an interview on Monday after the voting session .',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK/WASHINGTON - The U.S. government ’ s review of a landmark 2010 financial reform law will not be complete by early June as originally targeted , and officials will now report findings piece-by-piece , with priority given to banking regulations , sources familiar with the matter said on Monday . President Donald Trump has pledged to do a “ big number ” on the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law , which raised banks ’ capital requirements , restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customers ’ money and created consumer protections in the wake of the financial crisis . In February , Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review the law and report back within 120 days , saying his administration expected to be cutting large parts of it . But the Treasury Department is still filling vacancies after the transition from the Obama administration and there are not enough officials to get the full review done by early June , three sources said . A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the idea the report that would be broken up because the department is short-handed , saying the reach of the project could require several separate reports , as permitted under the executive order . “ Treasury has an entire team dedicated to reviewing the financial regulatory rules and will begin reporting our findings to the president in June , ” the department spokesperson said . “ Given the volume and scope of the issues we are reviewing that involve potential changes to the financial regulatory system , we are carefully considering the best options to begin rolling them out in the most effective and responsible manner , ” the spokesperson said . The Treasury Department will first report back on what banking rules could be changed , including capital requirements , restrictions on leverage and speculative trading . Examinations of capital markets , clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later , the sources said . It could be several months until these other stages of the financial reform review are completed , some of the sources said . The piecemeal approach could create challenges for some sectors if parts of the report are significantly delayed . The report has been highly anticipated , as it marks the new administration ’ s most detailed foray into outlining what it wants to do with financial rules . Trump previously has spoken only in broad terms about easing regulation surrounding lending . Any efforts to rework existing regulations or craft new legislation will be a lengthy and contentious process , something that banking lobbyists have said will make any delay to the administration ’ s initial findings costly for businesses eager for regulatory relief . Former BlackRock Inc executive Craig Phillips is leading the administration ’ s plan for financial deregulation . Alongside other Treasury officials , he is soliciting feedback from banking industry groups and executives for how banking policy should be shaped . The change in the timing of the Treasury report comes after Trump ordered a separate review of some key planks of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law . In April , Trump signed a pair of executive orders directing a review of two additional regulatory powers - orderly liquidation authority , which allows regulators to step in and wind down a failing financial institution , and systemic designation , in which certain large firms may be deemed critical to the overall health of the financial system , meriting stricter oversight . The findings from those reviews are not expected until October .',\n",

The vote tally at first favored Nasralla , but then swung in favor of the incumbent after hold-ups in the count , fueling talk of irregularities . International concern has grown about the crisis in the poor coffee-producing nation of more than 9 million , which experienced a military-backed coup in 2009 and suffers from drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates . The delays have already led to violence , and observers fear they could risk undermining the eventual winner s legitimacy . One of the four magistrates on the Honduran electoral tribunal flagged serious doubts about the process on Thursday . Marcos Ramiro Lobo called for an independent external auditor to review the results , but was non-committal on whether there was evidence of electoral fraud . We can t be sure of one thing or the other , Lobo told Reuters , expressing concern about the vote count breaking down . What I do know is that serious doubts are being raised . David Matamoros , who chairs the electoral tribunal , on Thursday evening heeded calls from international election observers and Honduras top business group , and said the tribunal would hand-count some 1,031 outstanding ballots , or roughly 6 percent of the total , that had irregularities . That fresh count would be completed in up to two days , and would allow the tribunal to declare a definitive winner with 100 percent of ballots counted , Matamoros said . The tribunal s latest tally showed that with 94.31 percent of ballots counted , Hernandez had secured 42.92 percent of the vote , with Nasralla at 41.42 percent . The Organization of American States ( OAS ) appeared to have salvaged the credibility of the election on Wednesday by eliciting signed statements from both candidates who vowed to respect the final result once disputed votes had been checked . But a few hours later , Nasralla rejected the accord , saying his opponents were trying to rob him . He urged supporters to take to the streets to defend his triumph . They take us for idiots and want to steal our victory , said Nasralla , who heads a center-left coalition . Nasralla is one of Honduras best-known faces and is backed by former President Manuel Zelaya , a leftist who was ousted in the 2009 coup after he proposed a referendum on his re-election . On Thursday , Nasralla s coalition issued a statement signed by Zelaya , in which the former president asked for more transparency in the vote count , and said the coalition could not currently accept any decision issued by the tribunal . Luis Larach , the president of COHEP , a powerful business lobby , told that given the slim difference between the candidates , the hand-count of irregular ballots would be crucial in deciding the winner . For me , it s still up in the air , he said . Nasralla s followers took to the streets , protesting throughout Honduras on Thursday . At least nine people were injured in protests in the capital , Tegucigalpa , as well as two police officers and a soldier , emergency services said . Six of the nine had been shot . There were also reports of a police station and highway toll booths set alight in other parts of Honduras . We re going to keep protesting and won t let them steal this victory , said university student Josue Valladares , 20 , as he battled with security forces , who were guarding a vote-count center in Tegucigalpa . The sporadic way in which results have been published , and the reversal of Nasralla s lead , have led the opposition to say Hernandez may have influenced the election tribunal , an allegation Hernandez denies . Opinion polls before the election indicated that Hernandez was favored to win . On Thursday , the OAS urged the tribunal to process all of the ballots before declaring a winner , as did a European Union election monitor . On Monday , the tribunal published more than half the results , showing Nasralla with a five point lead , but then published nothing more for 36 hours . When the count started again , Hernandez began to catch Nasralla . The count has started and stopped ever since . The tribunal blamed a five-hour delay on Wednesday on computer glitches .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama exhorted fellow Democrats on Wednesday to preserve his legacy-defining healthcare law as Republicans moved ahead with their long-sought bid to scrap it in what Vice President-elect Mike Pence called the “ first order of business ” of Donald Trump ’ s administration . The emerging Democratic strategy is to warn that Republicans risk throwing the entire U.S. healthcare system into chaos by moving to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , without a plan to replace it . Republicans argue the system is already broken and that they will help more people gain coverage by repealing the law while working to minimize disruptions to those who depend on it . Both Obama and Pence visited Capitol Hill for closed-door discussions on Obamacare . Pence , the Indiana governor and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives , met Republican lawmakers to plot the path forward on scuttling the law . “ The first order of business is to keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the kind of healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government , ” Pence told a news conference . Down the hall from Pence , Obama , who hands over the presidency to Trump on Jan. 20 , urged Democratic lawmakers to protect his signature domestic policy measure . He told reporters his message was : “ Look out for the American people. ” Democrats acknowledge they lack the votes needed to stop repeal legislation being pushed by Republicans , who will control the White House and both chambers of Congress when Trump takes office . But they are warning of the risks of the repeal legislation in hopes of spurring a public backlash against it . Without a replacement by Republicans , as early as 2018 , the roughly 20 million people who gained insurance under the law could see their coverage in jeopardy . “ The Republican plan to cut healthcare wouldn ’ t ‘ make America great again , ’ ” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters , invoking Trump ’ s campaign slogan . “ It would make America sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care. ” Since the law was enacted , Republicans in Congress have voted more than 50 times to try to repeal all or part of it and conservatives have filed suits to try to invalidate it . Republicans criticize Obamacare as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by adding burdens on businesses . Republicans on Wednesday stepped up their rhetorical attack on Obamacare , with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying the law ruined the American healthcare system . Trump wrote on Twitter that Republicans “ must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster , with its poor coverage and massive premium increases. ” Pence said Trump would work with congressional leaders for a “ smooth transition to a market-based healthcare reform system ” through legislative and executive action . Republicans have offered few details , however , on what a replacement for Obamacare would look like . Ryan said lawmakers would take action that did not “ pull the rug out from anybody ” and that the party had “ plenty of ideas. ” Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow said Republicans were “ pulling the string that ’ s going to unravel the whole ( healthcare ) system. ” Schumer said any effort by Republicans to shift the blame to Democrats would fail : “ They want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us . Not going to happen . It ’ s their responsibility , plain and simple. ” The House Republican Study Committee , composed of the most conservative members of the chamber , signaled they were aware of the risk of appearing not to have a plan and filed a bill on Wednesday that could constitute a replacement . House Republicans last year offered a proposal that would , among other things , provide refundable tax credits to help people afford their medical insurance premiums . Obamacare helped people obtain insurance by increasing funding to states to expand the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and providing government subsidies to help people obtain coverage from private insurers through government-run exchanges . Republican Senator Rand Paul , who is a doctor , joined the Democrats in voting against beginning consideration of the Obamacare repeal resolution . While Paul said he supported repealing the law , he added the current proposal would increase the government debt by $ 9.7 trillion in the next 10 years . “ Is that really what the Republican Party represents ? ” Paul said during Senate floor debate . The United States has a more complicated healthcare system than some other rich nations whose governments provide medical coverage . Many Americans get health insurance through their employers . Others buy policies directly from private insurers or are eligible for government-run programs for elderly and low-income people . About 29 million had no medical insurance in 2015 , according to the most recent government statistics . The U.S. population tops 320 million people . Trump has vowed to protect some popular parts of Obamacare , such as barring insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions .',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS - NATO allies on Friday publicly raised concern about a Russian cruise missile system that the alliance says may break a Cold War-era pact banning such weapons , in a show of support for Washington . The United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched cruise missile system with a range that is prohibited by a 1987 treaty , which could give Russia the ability to launch a nuclear strike on Europe on short notice . Allies have identified a Russian missile system that raises serious concerns , the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said in a statement . NATO urges Russia to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way , and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States . In a separate statement , the U.S. envoy to NATO , Kay Bailey Hutchison , said : Russia s behavior raises serious concerns . Russia has denied it is violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty . U.S.-led NATO s concerns are likely to further strain relations between Moscow and the West that are already at a low over Russia s 2014 seizure of Crimea , Western sanctions on the Russian economy and U.S. accusations that Moscow used computer hackers to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election . Moscow denies that it interfered in the election . The NATO statement follows a meeting between Russia and the United States in Geneva this week to mark the 30th anniversary of the treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union . According to an April U.S. State Department report , Washington determined in 2016 that Russia was in violation of its treaty obligations not to possess , produce , or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km ( 310-3,417 miles ) , or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles . Last week , the State Department said it is reviewing military options , including new intermediate-range cruise missile systems , the first response by U.S. President Donald Trump s administration to the U.S. charges . The Russian foreign ministry said last week it was ready for talks with the United States to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the United States did . In a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the IMF treaty last week , the Russian foreign ministry said Moscow considered the language of ultimatums and sanctions unacceptable .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The heads of the U.S. agencies that regulate securities and commodities pressed a Senate committee on Tuesday to boost their budgets in the face of growing sophistication in financial markets and technology , but lawmakers gave no sign extra dollars were coming soon . In his proposed budget , President Barack Obama requested an 11 percent increase for the Securities and Exchange Commission , bringing its spending to $ 1.781 billion . He also sought a 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , to give the agency overseeing the $ 400 trillion U.S. swaps market as well as commodities trading , a $ 331 million budget . The SEC offsets any taxpayer funds it receives with user fees and fines , which means its spending does not affect the federal deficit . But Senator John Boozman of Arkansas , the Republican chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on financial services , said that did not leave it free of oversight . “ Congress has a responsibility to ensure those funds are being spent in a manner that protects investors , helps markets operate efficiently and spurs economic growth for all Americans , ” he said at Tuesday ’ s hearing . He added that “ access to more funding does not necessarily ensure that an agency will successfully achieve its mission or spend that funding responsibly. ” For the SEC , “ additional funding is imperative if we are to continue the agency ’ s progress in fulfilling its responsibilities over our increasingly fast , complex and growing markets , ” Chair Mary Jo White said . It would help the SEC hire “ 250 staff in critical , core areas and continue to improve our information technology. ” The new staff would allow the SEC to conduct more exams , increase data analytics and improve intelligence gathering for enforcement cases , she added . At the hearing , CFTC Chair Timothy Massad said the agency “ does not have the resources necessary to adequately oversee ” its markets , especially “ with an industry that is changing and innovating at the speed of light and that is much larger and more complex than even just a few years ago. ” More than a third of the extra dollars requested would go toward information technology , he said . Part of the increase , $ 15.5 million , would go toward enforcement because the CFTC faces “ an increasing number of well-financed defendants with high-powered defense teams. ” Massad added the CFTC was working to change the levels of its fines , saying levies for many violations were “ far too low . ”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he wants to know more about President Donald Trump ’ s business dealings in relation to Russia , but that congressional investigations may have to avoid the matter if they conflict with an FBI probe . Graham asked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Monday whether he had concerns about Russian ties to Trump ’ s business interests . Clapper said he could not comment because the issue could be a subject of an ongoing investigation . CNN reported on Tuesday that Graham intended to look into Trump ’ s business ties to see if any connections exist between Russia and the Trump campaign or the president ’ s associates . The White House said it would welcome any fact-finding by Graham and the subcommittee , which he chairs , saying the president has no business ties to Russia . “ He has no business in Russia ; he has no connections to Russia , ” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters . “ So he welcomes that. ” Spicer added that Trump had directed a law firm to send Graham a certified letter stating as much . While Graham expressed interest in finding out whether Trump ’ s business interests had any Russia ties , he said the subcommittee may have to “ steer clear ” of the issue if it conflicts with the FBI ’ s probe of Russia and the Trump campaign . He clarified later that he had not taken any new actions . “ This is nothing new here , ” he told reporters at the Capitol . “ I ’ m not a prosecutor . But if you ask me if I want to know if there are any Trump business ties to Russia that are inappropriate , the answer would be ‘ yes. ’ ” Graham told CNN it would be helpful to see Trump ’ s tax records but that it was too soon to say whether he would be willing to subpoena them , the network said .',\n",
       " 'ISTANBUL - Muslim leaders on Wednesday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and called on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine . Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan , who hosted the summit of more than 50 Muslim countries in Istanbul , said the U.S. move meant Washington had forfeited its role as broker in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict . From now on , it is out of the question for a biased United States to be a mediator between Israel and Palestine , that period is over , Erdogan said at the end of the meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member states . We need to discuss who will be a mediator from now on . This needs to be tackled in the U.N. too , Erdogan said . A communique posted on the Turkish Foreign Ministry website said the emirs , presidents and ministers gathered in Istanbul regarded Trump s move as an announcement of the U.S. Administration s withdrawal from its role as sponsor of peace . It described the decision as a deliberate undermining of all peace efforts , an impetus ( for ) extremism and terrorism , and a threat to international peace and security . Leaders including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , Iran s President Hassan Rouhani and Jordan s King Abdullah , a close U.S. ally , all criticized Washington s move . Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Palestine , Abbas said , adding Trump s decision was the greatest crime and a violation of international law . Asked about the criticism at a State Department briefing in Washington , spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that despite the inflammatory rhetoric from the region , Trump is committed to this peace process . That type of rhetoric that we heard has prevented peace in the past , she said , urging people to ignore some of the distortions and focus on what Trump actually said . She said his decision did not affect the city s final borders , which were dependent upon negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians . But when asked whether East Jerusalem could similarly be recognized as the capital of a future Palestinian state , Nauert said that determination should be left to final status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians . We re taking a position on how we view Jerusalem , she said . I think it s up to the Israelis and Palestinians to decide how they want to view the borders - again final status negotiations . Abbas told OIC leaders in Istanbul that Washington had shown it could no longer be an honest broker . It will be unacceptable for it to have a role in the political process any longer since it is biased in favor of Israel , he said . This is our position and we hope you support us in this . Jerusalem , revered by Jews , Christians and Muslims alike , is home to Islam s third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades . Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally . The communique on the Turkish ministry website and a separate Istanbul Declaration distributed to journalists after the meeting said the leaders called on all countries to recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine . We invite the Trump administration to reconsider its unlawful decision that might trigger ... chaos in the region , and to rescind its mistaken step , the declaration said . Iran , locked in a regional rivalry with Saudi Arabia , said the Muslim world should overcome internal problems through dialogue so it could unite against Israel . Tehran has repeatedly called for the destruction of the Israeli state and backs several militant groups in their fight against it . America is only seeking to secure the maximum interests of the Zionists and it has no respect for the legitimate rights of Palestinians , Rouhani told the summit . King Abdullah , whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel more than 20 years ago , said he rejected any attempt to alter the status quo of Jerusalem and its holy sites . Abdullah s Hashemite dynasty is custodian of Jerusalem s Muslim sites , making Amman sensitive to any changes in the city . Not all countries were represented by heads of government . Some sent ministers and Saudi Arabia , another close ally of Washington s , sent a junior foreign minister . Summit host Turkey has warned that Trump s decision would plunge the world into a fire with no end in sight . Erdogan described it as reward for Israeli actions including occupation , settlement construction , land seizure and disproportionate violence and murder . Israel is an occupying state ( and ) Israel is a terror state , he told the summit . I invite all countries supporting international law to recognize Jerusalem as the occupied capital of Palestine , Erdogan told OIC leaders and officials . Trump s declaration has been applauded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who said Washington had an irreplaceable part to play in the region .',\n",
       " 'HONG KONG - Macau s mostly pro-democracy opposition made slight gains in legislative elections , as critics saw signs of public dissatisfaction with the pro-Beijing government after a deadly typhoon battered the Asian gambling hub a month ago . Results of Sunday s vote announced on Monday showed the opposition camp won five seats in the 33-seat legislative assembly , one more than at the last election four years ago , according to local media reports . Macau s political landscape has long been dominated by pro-establishment , pro-Beijing and casino industry interests , and critics viewed any improvement by the opposition as an achievement . Only 14 of the legislative seats were directly elected , a far lower proportion than in neighboring Hong Kong , also a China-ruled former colony , that has pushed much harder and wrested greater democratic freedoms than Macau , which returned from Portuguese to Chinese rule in 1999 . Twelve other seats are indirectly elected in smaller constituencies , while another seven are appointed by Macau s Beijing-backed leader , Fernando Chui , making chances of opposition ever gaining a majority all but impossible . Among the winners was 26-year-old pro-democracy activist and outspoken government critic , Sulu Sou , who becomes the youngest ever Macau lawmaker . Sou was one of the young leaders that helped spearhead one of Macau s largest anti-government protests three years ago , when around 20,000 people rallied against a bill offering a generous compensation package to outgoing officials . Macau s leader , Chui , later withdrew it . In the past four years , people in Macau went through different battles , large and small , Sou wrote on his Facebook page after his victory . Today , people in Macau are using their votes to express their determination for change . Sou couldn t be immediately reached by for comment . Unlike neighboring Hong Kong , large-scale protests are rare and grassroot dissent is relatively muted in Macau , a former Portuguese colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1999 under a one country , two systems arrangement . The election took place less than a month after Typhoon Hato wrought havoc in Macau , killing ten people . The government s failure to warn people of the devastating storm , a lack of preparedness , along with widespread and protracted cuts to power and water supplies drew public anger and exposed Macau s inadequate infrastructure . While the opposition s gain was marginal , critics said the high 57 percent turnout rate and Sou s win should be a wake-up call for the government . It s an ideal result ... The people came out in greater numbers to support the opposition , Au Kam-sang , a veteran pro-democracy lawmaker who was re-elected , told Reuters . It reflects the incompetence of the Macau government and the aftermath of typhoon Hato , Au added . ( This story corrects second paragraph to say previous election was four years ago , not five )',\n",
       " 'Fox News needs to take Andrea Tantaros sexual harassment lawsuit seriously because she refuses to back down.The conservative network has repeatedly belittled Tantaros and called her a liar ever since she slapped Fox News with a sexual harassment lawsuit naming Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly.Tantaros has even dared her former Fox employers to take a lie detector test , even offering to take one herself because she has nothing to hide . But now Tantaros has some serious reinforcements who can back up her sexual harassment claims.As it turns out , the former host of Outnumbered was distraught enough about the demeaning working environment at Fox News that she saw a professional therapist starting in 2014 to deal with how she was constantly being treated by Fox bigwigs.Dr . Michele Berdy has now written a sworn affidavit confirming that Tantaros spoke with her about how Ailes would tell her to wear tighter dresses and how he would demand her to stand up and turn around so he could ogle her . Tantaros also told Berdy about Bill O Reilly s unwanted advances and how Fox PR chief Bill Shine ordered her to not file complaints about Ailes behavior.Berdy wrote that after reading reports about Fox denying the claims , she reached out to Tantaros and gave her support . Over the course of many months ( 2014 2016 ) , Andrea relayed to me on multiple occasions instances of Mr. Ailes s demeaning and overtly predatory behavior , as well as the abusive conduct of Fox News s public relations department , Berdy wrote.Berdy confirmed that Tantaros spoke to her repeatedly about how she sought help from Bill Shine to make the harassment stop but he did nothing except basically tell Tantaros to just let it happen and allow Ailes to continue harassing her . In addition , Berdy confirmed Tantaros claim that Ailes retaliated against her for refusing to comply with his sexual demands.Berdy also backed up Tantaros story of how O Reilly approached her on multiple occasions to invite her to a private beach house , which he did because he had heard that she is wild . Here are images of parts of the affidavit via Twitter.This is a pretty damning affidavit against Fox News , which has already had to make a pretty hefty payment to former host Gretchen Carlson over her own sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes.The fact that Tantaros had to see a therapist to deal with the constant abuse at her workplace and that her complaints were documented long before she filed the lawsuit bring even more credibility and sympathy to her story.It s time for Fox News to clean house and fire the people who are responsible for covering for Ailes and it s time to fire anyone who sexually harassed female employees at the network , including Bill O Reilly and even Steve Doocy , whom Carlson named in her lawsuit.Fox News thinks they can bully Tantaros and make her lawsuit go away . But she isn t backing down and it s only getting worse for Fox the longer this lawsuit plays out.Featured image via Dangerous Minds',\n",
       " 'Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 1994 cult film Natural Born Killers , is an examination of media manipulation , archetypal psychology and the violence embedded within American pop culture.Although it s been more than two decades since Natural Born Killers ( NBK ) first shocked viewers with its adrenaline fueled brutality , biting satire and darkly ironic media montages , the enigmatic picture s overall depiction of the American media complex is just as effective today . CHAOS ROAD Mickey and Mallory Knox are depraved icons in the twisted world of NBK . ( Photo illustration : Shawn Helton ) On the film s jarring surface , we see Micky ( portrayed by Woody Harrelson ) and Mallory Knox ( Juliet Lewis ) metaphorically reborn ( from their violent past ) as outlaw-lovers embarking on a psychopathic cross country murder spree but as well come to find out , there s much more to this psychologically challenging piece of cinema.Over the years , NBK has seen comparisons to Hollywood crime classics such as the Badlands ( 1973 ) , Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) , the serial killer mockumentary , Man Bites Dog ( 1992 ) , as well as the dystopian mind-bender , A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 ) . NBK has also been thematically linked to Network ( 1976 ) , another motion picture with a scathing appraisal of mass media , as well as the 1960 s road-film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) , and the strikingly similar dark thriller Kalifornia ( 1993 ) , which also starred Juliet Lewis playing a near identical role.In many ways , much of the media driven subtext of NBK has never seemed more relevant than now , as the film recognized mass media s growing obsession with violence and trashy entertainment all at once . The film also acknowledged the public s fixation with reality TV in all of its incarnations , perhaps envisaging the multi platform information craze in the age of social media.To this day , the Oliver Stone directed controversial feature Natural Born Killers ( Based on a story by Quentin Tarantino ) remains a harsh critique of American media and pop culture , as it casts a spotlight on the lurid agitprop used to steer public perception through various forms of infotainment.Over the course of this analysis , we ll explore some of the underlying aspects of Natural Born Killers , as well as contextualize its relation to real-life violence seen in the modern era CULT OF PERSONALITY Natural Born Killers reflects the heartless transformation of mass media.On The Road : Tragedy & SatireFrom the outset , sight , sound and mood take precedence over a traditional narrative structure throughout NBK . The film begins with a roadside montage of predatory animals ( coyote , eagle rattlesnake ) struggling to survive while Leonard Cohen s classic song Waiting for the Miracle slowly fades in creeping along to the foreboding imagery . The sequence subliminally conjures the all too familiar eugenics based survival of the fittest axiom something which reflects the ruinous and fractured socio-political environment that has become so pervasive in modern America.All the while , the action shifts dramatically from grainy black-and-white footage of America s Southwest , to a red filtered glow , then back to full color , as elliptical-style editing ( as well as cross-cutting and parallel ) sets the tone for the illusory motion picture magnified by its tension inducing dutch-style camera angles.18 different film formats were used to create NBK in addition to many unusual lighting techniques everything from black-and-white to dusty old 8mm , to 16mm , to 35mm stock , to CCTV video and animation . DINE & DASH NBK sees Mickey Knox on a quest to become Nietzsche s Overman . When the establishing sequence of NBK finally settles inside the 5 to 2 Cafe , we see a television rapidly changing channel to channel going from the all-american series Leave It to Beaver , to 77 Sunset Strip , a late 1950 s secret agent crime drama , to the resignation speech of President Richard Nixon , which is juxtaposed against an old horror film relic featuring Boris Karloff.The short panning shot is emblematic of America s dark evolution during the 20th century and serves as a stark bell weather for the rest the high paced surreal picture . In fact , strategically placed images , products and objects are seen throughout the entirety of NBK , evoking a strong emotional response in the viewer bringing to mind the psychology behind propaganda . DAEMON Subliminal dissolves bring a mystical depth to NBK.In the movie s first scene , the camera slips across the cafe , sliding past a character later revealed to be Owen Traft ( Arliss Howard ) , who is a guardian angel or daemon , linked to the Knox pair . Traft vanishes before our eyes ( Traft is later seen in the film s prison break sequence ) while reading a newspaper about the highway 666 murders , prefiguring the dark media frenzy soon to envelop the Knox outlaws.Celebrating after a fresh deer kill , a pack of foul-mouthed cowboys file into the 5 to 2 Cafe . We then see Mickey order a key lime pie , as his partner in crime Mallory , looking part prostitute , part Pocahontas , seductively dances to the jukebox . Mickey surveys the room and a bright toxic green is contrasted against some of the action within the scene . While some green tones traditionally have a calming restorative quality , the kind used in NBK denotes a sickness inside the mind . SPIRIT ANIMAL NBK s cafe cowboys run over a scorpion on the road , impacting their fate when facing Mallory and her quasi-totem.Shortly thereafter , Mallory challenges one of the boozed-up misogynistic buckaroos to hand to hand combat just as L7 s Shit List kicks in on the jukebox . The cafe scene erupts into chaos as the soon-to-be famous fugitives dispatch all but one person ( the pinball cowboy ) in the roadside cafe . The pinball cowboy is kept alive to tell the tale of Mickey and Mallory , in a twisted version of the counting game Eeny , meeny , miny , moe.Following the murderous cafe ruckus , the Knoxes ride out into the desert as wild dissolves intertwine with projected news clippings , images of past crimes and the Hydra myth in the form of a monster flick clip . Additionally , there s a musical schizophrenia to NBK , with a collection of modern and classic songs intermixed with fragmented and atmospheric snippets , signifying a faded , yet stitched together memory in the Trent Reznor/Jane Hamsher selected soundtrack.Later on during a roadside pit stop , Mallory invokes the Book of Revelations and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , as she describes seeing a vision of Mickey riding a red ( war ) horse , while suggesting the star-crossed lovers might be fallen angels . At that same moment , a floating image of a multi-armed Mallory is seen in the sky , bringing to mind the devouring Hindu goddess Kali . CUPID S REVENGE NBK s dingy satire of TV sitcoms of old in I Love Mallory serves as a dysfunctional backdrop to Mickey and Mallory s hard-edged romance.Oedipal , Electra & the Hidden OrderContinuing by the roadside , the scene drifts into a dream sequence/flashback in the form of a 1950 s style sitcom parody entitled I Love Mallory . Here we see Mallory s dysfunctional family completely controlled by her abusive and incestuous father Ed Wilson ( Rodney Dangerfield ) . The scene is an inversion of the soft TV sitcoms dominating the airwaves in real-life , as the lecherous Wilson unleashes a disturbing diatribe amid a background laugh-track.During the same scene , a deliveryman named Mickey enters the frame , falling in love with Mallory at first sight . Mickey leaves with Mallory and in the process steals Ed s car . Later , Mickey is arrested and imprisoned , managing to escape from a prison work farm during a tornado . NBK s tornado prison break , may be seen as a reference to the classic film The Wizard of Oz a storm system which forever alters Mickey s future world.Mickey and Mallory return to the Wilson residence , seeking revenge on Mallory s father and mother , in what could be seen as a loose interpretation of the dark lyrical finish to the enigmatic song The End by The Doors . The Wilson s are murdered in a shocking home invasion scene and the house is set ablaze , while Mallory s brother Kevin ( Sean Stone ) is set free during the inferno.With each new set of kills , Mickey and Mallory grow closer and after their demented Oedipal/Electra complex resolution at the Wilson residence , the two get hitched in a blood ritual ceremony filmed on the scenic Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in Taos , New Mexico . Here Mickey proclaims the couple s marriage is sanctified because he is the god of his world , conjuring Friedrich Nietzsche s Overman concept , as well as a Apollonian/Dionysian influence within the killer s process.In an analysis entitled , The Dionysian and the Apollonian in Nietzsche : The Birth of Tragedy , by Alexander Gatherer of Cardiff University , we are provided a more detailed look at both the Apollonian and Dionysian philosophical concepts : The opposing concepts of the Dionysian ( hereon DI ) and Apollonian ( hereon AP ) are central themes within Nietzsche s first major work , The Birth of Tragedy ( hereon BT ) . His contemplation of such opposing forces of nature are primarily used to analyse Greek culture in general , and Greek art in particular , stating that its role in Greek attic tragedy places these plays at Greece s cultural pinnacle . Continuing , Gatherer s essay analyzes critical aspects of AP and DI : Nietzsche s concepts of the AP and DI , along with the entirety of BT , were not well received initially : the author himself called the book badly written , ponderous , embarrassing , image-mad and image-confused ( Sweet , 1999 , p.49 ) . However , the ideas have left a notable legacy and are still discussed in matters of ethics , politics and art . Indeed , Michael Motta ( 1991 ) likens the opposing forces to mental illness , stating how stages of mania in bipolar artists can be likened to that of the DI ( The urge to create is great , but the ability to step back , to control the process is reduced ) , with depressive phases linked to the AP ( Critique and reflection take precedence over impulsivity , inhibition holds sway over exhibitionism ) . With this in mind , we can interpret Mickey and Mallory s unresolved tension between AP and DI , as a philosophical reason for their dissent into madness.Although in Stone s view , Mickey and Mallory are tragically flawed because of a failed system , which frames the prison system , the police system and mass media , as the true American criminals . However , this ideological stance of the film is itself a false paradigm stuck in a social justice vortex , while masked in Carl Jung s rebel archetype pointing to Stone s sometimes radical political perspective.Returning to NBK , we see Mickey and Mallory make a blood pact and exchange snake rings presented by Mickey , who is connected to the reptilian realm via his Caduceus chest tattoo . At significant points during NBK , snake imagery is observed , recalling the occult and mythological associations of the serpent . Additionally , there seems to be a Shiva/serpent attachment linked to Mickey as a counterpart to Mallory s Kali connection , with an underlying current of the symbol of immortality , Ouroboros . Other distorted biblical themes are also echoed during NBK , such as the Book of Genesis and the Garden of Eden exemplified by Mickey s assisted escape from prison by a rattlesnake.Many associations are often seen throughout NBK , which reflect a deeper archetypal presence contained within the film.In Anton Ehrenzweig s The Hidden Order of Art , we can explore a deeper analysis of the unconscious mind many elements that relate to the main characters in NBK : Some evidence of creative work and poemagogic phantasy points to incomplete superego maturation as an important source of mental illness . The ego has not absorbed the death instinct into the mute workings of the creative process so that self-destruction goes rampant to destroy entire itself . In other words , Mickey and Mallory lack any mature ethical component , which leads to their shared self-destructive psychosis , which in turn , is acted out in their murderous rage . Ehrenzweig , coined the phrase poemagogic , which is interpreted as an aspect emblematic of inducing the ego s creativity in a layered dream state . The nightmare/dream state of Mickey and Mallory visually comes to life in the strewn together time-worn scenes of NBK , like fragmented vitriolic memories . BLOOD BOND A ritualistic roadside marriage filmed on the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.Media Made Political AgitatorsWhen NBK continues , all of the berserker-like chaos is captured by Wayne Gale ( Robert Downey Jr. ) , a ratings consumed tabloid host on the fictitious television series American Maniacs . A show which obsessively covers the violent action of Mickey and Mallory at any cost . Gale is an amalgam of Australian TV s investigative host Steve Dunleavy and the long time reporter and talk show host Geraldo Rivera.American Maniacs uses the image of cult leader Charles Manson , University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman , and the sadistic killer Richard Ramirez during its credits , setting the tone for a sordid crime show reminiscent of The Current Affair and Hard Copy . NBK s representation of popular true crime programming , gives the film another disturbing art imitates life layer . In one scene , Gale describes the targeted killing of several law enforcement officers at the hands of the Knoxes which ironically , reflects many real-life crimes we see plastered across today s headlines in America.All in all , American Maniacs very well could have been a template for the seedy video-stringer film Night Crawler , while packaged in the marketing gloss of American Gladiators . In a world of news makers , Gale says repetition works , and when questioned over reusing reenacted death scenes by producers , he callously exclaims do you think those nitwits out there in zombieland remember anything . This is where we see Gale s mind warping programming taking shape for maximum psychological impact.This is what Stone s film is truly about , showcasing the often cold-hearted and calculating nature of mass media s carefully engineered narrative.With media analysis in mind , we might also consider this passage from Cult of Distraction in The Mass Ornament by film theorist , sociologist and writer , Siegfried Kracauer : Here , in pure externality , the audience encounters itself ; its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions . Were this reality to remain hidden from the viewers , they could neither attack nor change it ; its disclosure in distraction is therefore of moral significance . Whether its banal programming intermixed with mass media s terror lens , the viewer has a choice to accept the media manipulated distractions at wholesale or attempt to unpack them through critical thinking , questioning the very nature of reportage . AMERICAN MANIAC Gale s American Maniacs glorifies tragedy for ratings.As NBK moves forward , we see the media trail and trial of Mickey and Mallory after the duo has been taken into custody . In a mockumentary style scene centered around super-fans and tacit supporters of the Knoxes , there s a decidedly social justice flair to a series of fictitious man on the street interviews.The whole segment relates to various political agitator groups that we see today like Occupy Wall Street ( OWS ) and the controversial identity focused activism of Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) , as well as the FBI and the CIA s various counter-intelligence programs from the 1960 s and 1970 s. Both OWS and BLM alliances , are neo-liberal think-tank/NGO designed gatherings , meant to divide and control participants over class , identity and other socio-political concerns.NBK s court house scene featuring fervid group-think supporters , could be seen as another signal of social strife in America at the turn of the century marked pointedly by the polarizing corruption of the 1992 L.A. riots , the gross federal negligence of both the Ruby Ridge incident and the Waco siege , as well as the heavily publicized Menendez murder case ( the strange and salacious trials of Lorena Bobbit and Tonya Harding ) and the show trial of O.J . Simpson , an all-time ratings bonanza not counting the 95 million who watched Simpson s car chase on live TV.Interestingly though , the choreographed bombing of the World Trade Center ( 1993 ) carried out by FBI handlers and federal informants , was a curiously under reported event at the time . Which could be a reason for its absence from the media montages seen throughout NBK.The volatility of the 1990 s , proved to be an ideal backdrop for NBK , a picture made during a wave of high-profile sensationalized crime . MOTEL MAYHEM The murderous bride and groom conjuring the death of Mickey s innocence at the Lodge . Later on in NBK , with symbols fully on display , we see close camera shots of the pair s tattoos Mickey s light and dark Yin and Yang symbol and crudely drawn Christ-like tattoo are contrasted against Mallory s scorpion ink , as they ride along to abduct a hostage . As they make their way to the neon-lit Log Cabin Lodge , there very well could be a subtle reference to Freemasonary , when we witness the ritualistic behaviour shown at the Lodge . Stylistically , the motel resembles something out of the macabre cinematic world of David Lynch.In the background while Mickey and Mallory are on the motel bed , projected images on a window pane range from clips of raging dictatorships , to a young Mickey haunted by his father s suicide and a pale horse recalling the book of revelations once again . All of this takes place while a violent torture scene from the Hollywood film Scarface ( written by Oliver Stone ) plays out on the TV in front of their hostage.When love turns dark , Mickey and Mallory argue as time-lapse imagery of a Pray Mantis is seen symbolizing the need for contemplation during their chaos . The two separate briefly , as shamanic chanting cascades over their turbulent night crimes with visions of terror projected onto the sides of buildings.Whether its quick cut edits of opposing and often disturbing montages mixing vitriolic live action , clever special effects , absurdly horror filled projections or startling animated graphics reminiscent of Pink Floyd s The Wall NBK is a conceptual master work.As the hallucinogenic and often kinetic film progresses , a massive manhunt for the deranged Knoxes is launched by Detective Jack Super Cop Scagnetti , a masochistic vigilante law-man ( Tom Sizemore ) who has his own repressed demons to contend with , which manifest in his psychotic behavior towards prostitutes.We later learn that Scagnetti s mother was gunned down by the infamous shooter Charles Whitman at the University of Texas in 1966 . ROADSIDE SHAMAN The Knoxes come face to face with themselves during Red Cloud s vision.Shifting mood once again , we hear the haunting piano-driven History Repeats Itself by A.O.S , ( named after the 60 s counterculture chemist and sound engineer , Augustus Owsley Stanley III ) which atmospherically plays in the background as Mickey and Mallory high on hallucinogens , are lost , out of gas and at odds with one another . This is the first time Mallory questions Mickey and nature of events that led to her becoming a spree killer.While looking for gas , the Knoxes approach Red Cloud and his grandson , first passing by Jacob ( four-horned ) sheep , revealing another biblical reference with the presence of the rare breed of sheep guardians . This is another significant scene in NBK , as the sovereign Oglala Lakota activist Russell Means , adds unique depth to the sequence playing the Navajo , Warren Red Cloud ( perhaps a reference to US Marine Mitchell Red Cloud ) .Once inside Red Cloud s hut , the inner turmoil of the Knoxes is exposed . We then learn that Red Cloud served in the Vietnam War , reminding one of the staged Gulf of Tonkin false flag that led to the war . The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the ability to militarily engage in a full-scale conflict with North Vietnam , was made possible due to the fabrication of a crime.During the latter half of the Vietnam War , the development of controversial counter-terrorism techniques was at the utmost importance for then Director of the CIA , William Colby . One such program materialized named The Phoenix Program ( Operation Phoenix ) , which employed various terror tactics to destabilize the North Vietnamese leadership , claiming to have eradicated the Vietcong through the use of psy-ops , extortion , the release of criminals and random targeting of civilians to achieve its aims . Some geopolitical critics believe that this template for destabilization has been used in Afganistan , Iraq , Libya and Syria in recent years.Given that Stone himself was a Vietnam veteran in the US Army , we can view that the deliberate inclusion of Red Cloud s service record was a significant aspect to the story , perhaps reflecting the false premise that the Vietnam War was based upon . SKIN-WALKER Mickey s inner demons come to the surface prior to killing Red Cloud.The pivotal scene with Red Cloud dramatically altered the emotionally unhinged killers , who were taken on a shamanic journey and forced to face their own reality during a cleansing ritual involving chanting , fire and snakes . Here Mickey s torment and abuse comes to the surface with vivid drug induced flashbacks and after being haunted by his past , he awakens and shoots Red Cloud . The tragic death of Red Cloud , is the first time both Mickey and Mallory feel the weight of their actions.With an axe to grind against mass murders Mickey and Mallory , Scagnetti , manages to apprehend the pair in a dramatic shootout at the Drug Zone pharmacy after they were bitten by rattlesnakes following their quasi-spiritual pilgrimage conducted by Red Cloud . While observing the Drug Zone s logo we see the Caduceus image ( winged staff wrapped with two snakes ) often inappropriately used in medicine , as it is said to be the conductor of the dead . DRUG ZONE subconscious slogans envelop Mickey in the Drug Zone shootout with police . This neon green filtered scene also represents the poisonous consumer culture , as Mickey and Mallory , drugged and snake bitten , stalk to store for anti-venom like the walking dead . Mike Smith s energetic cartoon animation is also featured , as the pharmacist ID s the pair while watching Gale s American Maniacs . Mickey revels in his newfound celebrity catching himself on TV , before he and Mallory are taken in by Scagnetti . WATCHTOWER Charles Whitman opened fire on the 27th story of the University of Texas clock tower on August 1st , 1966 in one of the most well-known mass shootings in American history . ( Image Source : hartford courant ) Scagnetti later hatches a scheme to kill Mickey and Mallory with the fast-talking neurotic Warden Dwight McClusky ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , who plans his own twisted brand of justice inside the riotous Batonga Penitentiary . When Scagnetti s plot fails during NBK s prison riot scene , Mallory executes him in her cell.Scagnetti s fictitious link to a well-known true crime , merges the illusory world of NBK with the UT shooting , subconsciously grafting fantasy onto a traumatic event . In effect , the concept mimics the way news stories sometimes strangely and unexpectedly overlap within a blended hyper-reality of fact and fiction.In recent years , there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013 , as confirmed by RT below : Until earlier this month , a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe . All of that changed effective July 2 , when the Broadcasting Board of Governors ( BBG ) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations . The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US . An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year . There has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years , despite claims that the NDAA provision offered more transparency to the American public.On another note , there are other uncanny historical elements associated with NBK Fresh off his fame from the hit sitcom Cheers , Woody Harrelson was an intriguing choice to play the character Mickey Knox , as it emerged that his father Charles Harrelson , was a contract killer linked to organized crime . Charles was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named Sam Degelia Jr in 1968 . Later in 1981 , he received two life sentences for the murder of US District Judge John H Wood . THREE TRAMPS Charles Harrelson ( ID d by forensic experts on the left ) is believed to be one of three arrested in Dealey Plaza after JFK s assassination in 1963 . ( Image Source : jfkmurdersolved ) It has been stated that after a six-hour suicidal standoff with police in 1980 , Charles , apparently high on cocaine admitted to killing Judge Wood , while also claiming to be involved in President John F. Kennedy s assassination.When considering the Harrelson-Kennedy connection , the 1989 book Crossfire comes to mind.Crossfire , written by the well-known researcher Jim Marrs , was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful Oliver Stone film JFK . Below is a passage from Crossfire , as it relates to the apparent Harrelson-Kennedy link : Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire , Harrelson the father of actor Woody Harrelson had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworld characters linked directly to Jack Ruby . Continuing , the Crossfire also stated : The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White , who testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations , already had noticed the resemblance of Harrelson to the youngest tramp . In a 1981 interview with Chuck Cook , Harrelson claimed to have the biggest story the reporter would ever have , when questioned about Kennedy s death . Additionally , Jo Ann Harrelson noted the similarities between the tramp photos and her husband . All this coupled with the fact Diane Lou Oswald ( the mother of Woody ) , who had also been married to Charles Harrelson in Midland , Texas , made for a strange background concerning the JFK saga.Throughout 1981 , more questions materialized regarding the assassination of Judge Wood in a UPI article , as Defense lawyers maintained [ Charles ] Harrelson was framed by police and the informant . Charles an ex-felon , said a friend , Hampton Robinson III , who failed to show up to testify , had driven the car . He suggested someone , possibly federal agents , had planted the guns so he could be arrested . He denied telling [ Department of Public Safety agent ] Pagel he carried a gun . Below , in a KDFW-TV interview in 1982 , Charles Harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing Kennedy but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the US government s involvement in the death of Kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in America.The interview is a startling revelation , adding to the enigmatic JFK mystery and in the process provides another strange backdrop to NBK Do you believe Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy alone We ll get back to that alone , without any aid from a rogue agency of the US government or at least a portion of that agency ? I believe your very naive if you do . Charles HarrelsonOn Independence Day in 1995 , Charles along with two other inmates , Gary Settle and Michael Rivers , tried to escape from Atlanta Federal Penitentiary later surrendering after warning shots were fired by guards . ENTROPY & ECSTASY - NBK s mass murder mayhem hits prime time TV.Fragmented Psyche , the Death Drive & Mind ControlWhen exploring the concept of Sigmund Freud s Death Drive and its relation to NBK , we should consider a thoughtful essay by Jon Mills entitled Reflections on the Death Drive . Here we can gain a better understanding of the tension at play within the psyche of Mickey and Mallory : Freud did not argue that death [ thantos ] was the only aim of life , only that it maintained a dialectical tension in juxtaposition to a life principle under the ancient command of Eros , yet the two forces of mind remained ontologically inseparable . In this relational age , the death drive appears to be a drowning man . Through this analysis , we can see the tug of war within the main characters of NBK caught within a life and death cycle.Also observed throughout the nonlinear narrative of NBK , are the media mobs and throngs of onlookers mesmerized by the murderous duo s violent deeds during the course of the film , arguably revealing a Schadenfreude ( joy derived from the misfortune of others ) .In essence , the abused become the abusers within the fragmented framework of NBK . This twist to the story pushes the observer into accepting and perhaps identifying with the malevolent turn of the Knoxes because of their own flawed and tragic upbringing . This reality is recognized in the rise against perceived corruption ( particularly law enforcement ) in the form of social justice group think.However , this is where the film purposely presents a false paradigm to those subconsciously seeking their own radical retribution something which further fractures the viewer s perception by utilizing stereotypical patterns or in this case violent molds to excuse the rampage carried out by Mickey and Mallory Knox.This type of false paradigm forms a preconditioned response in favor of vigilantism ; preventing the viewer s ability to see things in an unbiased way , which induces a type of cognitive dissonance in passive audiences , blocking one from considering a rational outlook in the aftermath of trauma.These concepts are central to understanding the nature of NBK , as it stirs questions about morality , societal behavior and the role played by both media and the public in an ongoing celebration of violence . In this sense , we can view NBK s excessive use of trauma-based imagery as statement about the modern age , a culture perpetually inundated by destructive media programming.In many ways , mind control abuse is heavily present within the topsy-turvy world of NBK . However , its presence in the film should be seen not necessarily as an indoctrination of the viewer but perhaps as a warning to those unaware of the psychic assault on their senses from all kinds of media.The film is laced with references to Dissociative Identity Disorder ( DID ) , conjuring the CIA s mind-warping military backed program , MK-Ultra , an illegal project that used hypnosis , sensory deprivation and other forms of torture to coerce an individual psychologically . This is represented in the film s main characters , as they vacillate between periods of ultra-violent behaviour and delusional wishful daydreaming , something which reflects a complex background of abuse.Here s an in-depth ABC news documentary examining Project MK-Ultra and the role played by Scottish-American psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron The heart of MK-Ultra is also seen in the controversial paper entitled From PSYOP to MindWar : The Psychology of Victory , written in part by the avowed satanist Michael Aquino , a high ranking security official , who was stated to have been inspired by Lieutenant Colonel John Alexander s article on pyschotronics , the employment of extrasensory perception , the transmission and reception of information via the mind.NBK s use of disturbing content might be best understood through its critique of mass media and the larger role that media has played in forcing trauma-based imagery on the public in a manner similar to that of covert military projects . In other words , NBK s volatile imagery is meant to be a savage attack on media itself and should be observed as a critique on media abuse as a whole not something that overtly supports cruelty.Other aspects of abuse are also present in NBK , whether it s Mallory s unseen abuse by her father Ed , the hostage held captive by the psychotic pair at the Lodge motel or Scagnetti s deranged and vile coping mechanism for his own tragic upbringing.Towards the end of the film , under a Stockholm Syndrome spell , crack reporter Gale , attempts to transform himself for the sake of Mickey and Mallory . This later leads to his demise , when he discovers he s not truly a natural born killer . We see the camera capture the action to tell the tale of Mickey and Mallory one more time . In the film s final surreal sequence , we see Mickey and Mallory driving in an RV as parents . The idea here is that the Knoxes represent a future society , a future nuclear family , one without traditional moral values , transformed by the death of American culture . This is something which is echoed by Leonard Cohen s song The Future at the end of the film . PRISON BREAK Mickey waxes poetic until a prison riot is sparked after talking to Gale . During the prison scene , Stone enlisted some 200 hardened criminals for the realistic riot scene.Cult Crimes & The Daily ShooterWhen concerning America s cult crimes , investigative journalist Maury Terry , and his book The Ultimate Evil , comes to mind . Winding down a dark and treacherous path , Terry s research uncovered the dark details about the so-called Helter Skelter killings , also known as the Tate-LaBianca murders , the Son of Sam shootings and other bizarre ritually crafted murders cascading across America from the 1960 s throughout the 1980 s.In an article published by Los Angeles Magazine , writer Michael Bendrix , discussed Terry s controversial book and the web of terror surrounding the apparent satanic ritual abuse ( SRA ) cult cases connected from coast to coast : Although Manson and David Berkowitz never knew each other , they both belonged at different times and on different coasts to the same umbrella satanic-cult organization , called the Process . The Process Church s dark history ( splintered off from Scientology ) , also recalls the Temple of Set church , a reboot of Anton Levay s Church of Satan , as well as Jim Jones and the People s Temple . Interestingly , Jones friend Dan Mitrione , was an operative trained in advanced counterinsurgency techniques , working with both the FBI and CIA , adding to the prevailing mystery of the Brian Jonestown massacre.According to the researcher John Judge , Jones , once a poor preacher , started People s Temple after meeting Mitrione . Judge uncovered much of the media manipulation in the aftermath of the Brian Jonestown massacre . Much of which , was used to besiege the American public through a distortion of facts something that we see reflected in many high profile cases today.In the arresting book Programmed to Kill by writer and researcher David McGowan , we see an examination of the American media and government agency propelled serial killer saga in a chapter entitled The Myth of the Serial Killer . Here is a passage that directly relates to the narrative of NBK and in some cases , crimes occurring in America today : Most Americans are probably familiar with what is considered the classic serial killer profile . This was a notion first put forth by the venerable FBI , which coined the term serial killer , and pioneered the concept of profiling , in an alleged attempt to understand the phenomenon of mass murder . It appears to be the case though the concept of the serial killer profile was put forth largely to misinform the public . In the case of Henry Lee Lucas , few if any of the elements of the serial killer profile apply . For instance , serial killers are said to act alone , driven to do so only by their own private demons . So far removed from ordinary behavior are their actions that they would not , indeed could not , share their private passions with others . In Henry s case , this is a patently false notion . It has been officially acknowledged that Lucas worked with not just one , but at times as many as three accomplices Later , McGowan links the CIA s politically motivated counter-insurgency campaign within Vietnam ( Operation Phoenix ) to a domestic version ( Operation CHAOS ) of terror , featuring serial killings throughout the 1960 s , in order to create a climate of fear to push for a police state crackdown.The CIA s Operation CHAOS collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973 , as admitted by the CIA.Over 40 years ago , a horrific crime spree took place sometime between 1972 -1974 that was dubbed the Zebra Murders . It was a shocking crime spree that shook the San Francisco area to the core.The murders were supposedly refered to as Zebra , because the radio communications channel that police talked over was channel Z . Reportedly , four Black Muslim men calling themselves the Death Angels were spawned from a known cointelpro hangout , Nation of Islam.The Death Angels were said to have shot future Mayor of San Francisco Art Angos . Some researchers on the subject have suggested that the Death Angels were trained counter-intelligence assassins tasked with fomenting a race war in America.In the 1990 s the idea of the lone serial killer phenomena faded into the background , exploding with the revamped media-driven image of the mass murder around every tabloid corner . When the decade came to a close , tabloid news produced the ratings that networks like ABC , CBS and NBC were starving for . The news world changed after the O. J. Simpson trial , opening the door for larger outlets to run the type of sensational TV programming previously reserved for popular shows like A Current Affair , Hard Copy and Inside Edition everything from salacious soft feature celebrity pieces , to murder stories and courtroom dramas such as Divorce Court and Judge Judy seeped into regular television fair.Similarly in the world today , the public has become reprogrammed by the fear-based odyssey of the War On Terror era and in more recent happenings such as the barrage of Daily Shooter mass casualty incidents rippling across America and Europe in the form of Gladio-style operations , we see another phase in the assault on reality . These cases have risen to the forefront in media as there is only a passing footnote concerned about serial killings , largely due to the public s desensitization.This new kind of crimescape injects the collective hive mind with a host of socio-political concerns over race , religion , reform and security , while obscuring the forensic synopsis of a crime itself.The notion that serial killers have in fact not acted alone under the lone wolf banner , coincides with findings about many of today s mass-shooters , who in a number of cases covered here at 21WIRE , have involved multiple suspects , actors and drills . Most recently in America , the events surrounding the Orlando Pulse night club were called into question , as eye-witness accounts suggested multiple suspects in the alleged lone wolf attack and that the authorities themselves may be to blame for some of the apparent deaths.Additionally , back in 2013 , the alleged Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen , was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months ( interviewed three times by the FBI between 2013-14 ) having worked for one of the largest security firms ( G4S Secure Solutions , headquartered in Jupiter , Florida ) in the US and around the world since 2007 . The firm was formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm , Wackenhut Corporation . Mateen s extensive background with G4S , reveals another yet another curious connection between security and terror.When discussing the mass shooter phenomena as it relates to terror and security , writer and researcher Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis , stated the following : The purpose of organized black op events is the psychological warfare effect of mass shootings . All warfare is psychological warfare , as the intent of the attacking party or army desires to bring about the acquiescence of the enemy . Warfare itself is merely a tool to bring about the psychological submission of the other side , while the intention of wiping out the enemy forces are secondary . Why deplete one s own forces and resources if the enemy can be molded to think accordingly ? In this sense , terrorism is the purposeful display of chaos and fear that arises from the radical disturbance of the normal , daily patterns and social routines of the enemy with the intent of achieving an alteration in the psyche of the target populace . Indeed , as critical pieces of Daily Shooter events come together evidence often suggests a highly organized and coordinated event involving many players . Those players then craft the three dimensions of how we are to view the event carrying out the event are as follows : members of the police and security services , and most crucially , members of the global media . The last and most important group provides the fourth dimension of this reality , and that is you the public.How you view any questionable event is the pinnacle for the architects of any impressive psy-op.A fifth dimension is based on the fourth , which is how the architects and social engineers observe your reactions to the event . From this , data is collected , social media is monitored , then metered , opinions are analyzed , and public reactions are measured . The conclusions will be used to form the baseline and design of future shock and awe operations reacting directly to the public s response . CASTING CRISIS Media fed madness hits the front page.Reality RebornIn an exploratory essay entitled Critical Theories of Mass Media : Then and Now , written by Paul A. Taylor and Jan Ll . Harris , we can see clearer role of NBK and how it relates to the modern era : The shock of the modern urban environment is figured in terms of a welter of new micro-perceptions , disorientating cuts and contingent images a realm of experience that also characterizes the cinematic experience . Cinema thus trains the sensorium and helps the subject adapt to this new technological social reality . While NBK covers some dark and sometimes philosophical territory , it often hints at something much darker than our imaginations can comprehend . In this sense , the viewer feels like a guilty voyeur in a culture of violence , reliving trauma gratuitously through the callous and obsessive lens of mass media.In the past critics and media have accused NBK itself of giving rise to copycat crimes as well as the Columbine High School massacre , and the Dunblane massacre . But interestingly , these two high profile shootings from the 1990 s have a number of questionable elements forensically , such as conflicting eyewitness testimony and how they were apparently carried out.NBK can be thought of as an ultra or hyper-reality , an unreality more real than reality . While critics of the film cite NBK s dangerous content and presentation , it employs a heavy dose of artificial reality in order to inject certain universal truths about the nature of man and media . In an article for Ceasefire magazine , Andrew Robinson deconstructs Jean Baudrillard s hyper-reality . A concept prominently observed while watching NBK : Hyperreality is a special kind of social reality in which a reality is created or simulated from models , or defined by reference to models a reality generated from ideas . The term has implications of too much reality everything being on the surface , without mystery ; more real than reality too perfect and schematic to be true , like special effects ; and para-reality , an extra layer laid over , or instead of , reality . It is experienced as more real than the real , because of its effect of breaking down the boundary between real and imaginary . It is a real without origin or reality , a reality to which we can not connect . In an informative piece by Randy Laist , Ph . D. , entitled , Murder and Montage : Oliver Stone s Hyperreal Period , we see a complex blended reality at play during NBK : Mickey and Mallory are the icons of the new reality : the image ripped out of its context , the innocent killer , the fictional character roaming free across the video prairies of the new manmade nature . Natural Born Killers elicits our own complicity with the cultural tendency it satirizes , blending critique with enactment in a way that collapses the border between character and audience as well as between moralistic valuations of guilt and innocence . In this perpetual age of terror , highly sophisticated methods are used to alter , distort and reform the public mind . NBK was able to pull back the curtain on mass media s scripted reign READ MORE ALTERNATIVE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire Hollywood Files',\n",
       " 'GUATEMALA CITY - Guatemala s Congress announced on Thursday that it will withdraw controversial reforms that critics had described as a serious setback in the country s fight against political corruption . On Wednesday , Guatemala s Congress approved a national emergency decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after President Jimmy Morales was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign . Morales , whose immunity from prosecution was reinforced by Congress earlier this week , had said he would veto the reforms if they were found to be harmful to the nation . After rowdy demonstrations in the capital on Thursday , Morales announced he had suspended an independence day parade that was to have taken place on Friday . And as the public outcry mounted , leaders of the principal parties in Congress agreed to vote on Friday to cancel the measures , independent congressman Oliverio Garc a said . There has been an objection from the general citizenship , organizations and institutions with respect to two decrees , and there is an agreement to not send those decrees to the executive ( branch ) and file them away definitively , he told reporters . The decrees would have been the latest blow to the attorney general s office and the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala ( CICIG ) after Congress this week voted to preserve Morales immunity from prosecution . Morales also urged Guatemalans on Thursday to remain calm and peaceful amid a charged atmosphere . The reforms were widely criticized in Guatemala , with opposition from the press and various government institutions and the human rights office . The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala , Todd Robinson , posted a scathing message on Twitter about the reforms , before Congress decided to withdraw them . Years of malnutrition , insecurity , crime , corruption . Congress ? No action . Amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution , he said . Separately , Morales presidential spokesman , Heinz Heimann , said the president would return a mysterious salary bonus that he had been receiving from the army and which raised his salary by more than a third , making him one of Latin America s best-paid leaders . The president returned it out of good faith , Heimann said of the payment , which is being probed by Guatemala s federal comptroller .

       " '21st Century Wire says The mainstream media continues to deflect from its own collapse in credibility in the wake of Hillary Clinton s epic electoral meltdown by inventing a synthetic fake news crisis and scapegoating Clinton s loss on bloggers and cheap eastern European hoax websites . In addition to mainstream media constantly pushing out actual fake news , corporate media giants have also created their own fake alternative media as well . Here are a number of media operatives appearing on TV pretending to be alternative media but in reality are really funded by the major broadcast media empires . One of these is a political news website called Vox.com . It s designed to look like an edgy alternative news source , but in reality , Vox is just another establishment consensus reality-building tool . Silicon Valley investors have pumped tens of millions of dollars into this media outlet , with the lead investor being none other than NBC Universal who are one of the biggest peddlers of actual fake news globally ( just ask their phony news anchor Brian Williams ) . Watch as FOX host Tucker Carlson takes apart hypocritical Vox staffer Timothy Lee over the issue of fake news circulating on the internet , revealing how Vox is also a producer of fake news too . As Carlson rightly points out this issue really boils down to freedom of speech.Caveat : Certainly , FOX News is not immune to pushing their own brand of fake news , especially when it comes to promoting US wars overseas , but it does have a number of capable pundits who have exposed a number of key revelations during the course of this historic 2016 Election .

       " 'If Donald Trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes , he should think again.As it turns out , Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has the power to indict Trump if he has enough evidence proving that Trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with Russia in an effort to win the 2016 Election . Donald Trump s son Trump Jr. has already demonstrated that Trump s campaign met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet Intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against Hillary Clinton , which is , indeed , the very definition of collusion.Mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a 56-page legal memo written by Ronald Rotunda , a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics , who was hired as part of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr s team during the Bill Clinton presidency.According to the 1998 memo , which was obtained by the New York Times , It is proper , constitutional , and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of , and are contrary to , the president s official duties . In this country , no one , even President Clinton , is above the law.That means no sitting president is above the law , including Trump.Watergate special counsel , Leon Jaworski , came to the same conclusion in 1974.The only reason why Jaworski and Starr declined to indict President Nixon and President Clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead.Well , Republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect Trump from being impeached . So it appears Mueller may not have a choice but to indict Trump if Republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty.Even the Supreme Court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in 1997 that a lawsuit against Clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward . And since Trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with Russia , that makes his misconduct open to indictment , along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office . That means if Mueller digs through Trump s finances and finds other crimes , Trump could face an indictment for those as well . If there is no recourse against the president , if he can not be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws , he will be above the law , Rotunda further wrote . If public policy and the Constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties ( and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties ) , and that is what Clinton v. Jones squarely held , then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater . In short , Trump is in deep shit and he can t blame Hillary Clinton to get out of it . Not even Republicans can dispute the Starr memo . Republicans not only supported Starr s investigation , it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo.So unless Republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all , Robert Mueller must indict Trump . Because it is clear that Republicans won t punish Trump for breaking the law and violating the Constitution.Featured Image : Addicting Info Archive',\n",
       " 'If you happened to see the University of Maryland s press releases touting the benefits of Fifth Quarter chocolate milk for athletes suffering from concussions , you might have wondered if it was an April fools joke.According to those press releases , University researchers discovered that chocolate milk helps improve the cognitive and motor functions of high school football players , even after suffering concussions . Not just any chocolate milk will do , though . The University s press releases claimed that a specific brand , Fifth Quarters , stands head and shoulders above other brands of chocolate milk when it comes to boosting the brain power of athletes and concussion sufferers.A press release posted in July of last year read more like a late-night infomercial hosted by Dr. Oz , rather than a University press release.Titled Super Natural Cows Make the Best Sports Recovery Drinks , it touted , not just best the benefits of Fifth Quarters chocolate milk , but the benefits of capitalism too , proclaiming : The magic formula for the ultimate sports recovery drink starts with cows , runs through the University of Maryland and ends with capitalism.According to the press release , which has since been removed from the University s website , but is still accessible through Google cache : Richard Doak and Kurt Williams stood behind a fence at a high school football game in the mountains of western Maryland and wondered why kids were getting injured more often . If it wasn t their training , they thought , then it had to be their nutrition.Next they did what any good parents would do they conducted research , created a solution and started a company so athletes everywhere could benefit from their discovery.If you think this sounds more like a cheesy advertisement than a summary of academic research , you wouldn t be alone.It gets worse.According to the press release , Doak and Williams were surprised by what they discovered : The freshest milk legally possible , from the best cows , provided more of what athletes bodies need than any artificial commercial drink : protein 20 grams , as much as most whey drinks , along with a special kind of protein that remains available for hours after drinking it ; electrolytes far more than products on the shelf ; and calcium and vitamin D for strong bones . They added natural cane sugar and cocoa to make it tasty for kids and to restore glycogen to muscles.But of course they needed proof of this.That s why they gave the University of Maryland $ 228,910 to conduct research through UMD s Industrial Partnership s Program.To understand what that program is , and what it means to the future of independent and ethical research , look no further than the school s own description of it , which cites academic-industrial , public-private partnerships . In other words , this is a program that conducts privately-funded research on behalf of businesses and corporations.In this case , the ethical problems were entirely obvious.Without releasing any details on the study , the press release proclaimed that : Jae Kun Shim , a professor of kinesiology in the School of Public Health , conducted a year-long study to test how well Fifth Quarter Fresh aides the post-exercise recovery of muscular endurance compared to other popular sports drinks . It outperformed competing products by 13-17 percent . It included the following remarks from Professor Shim : I knew they had a high-quality milk with less damaged protein [ than whey protein drinks ] and more electrolytes , but I didn t expect it would make much difference for strength endurance recovery . There are many studies out there that show the cardiovascular recovery benefits from milk-based products , but this data is unique because we are showing that the muscular endurance recovery from this chocolate milk is significant . Our data suggests that athletes may be ready faster and better for the next game or practice if they drink Fifth Quarter Fresh chocolate milk . And that s not all folk . According to Industry spokespersons , who had a heavy hand in both the research and the press release : One secret to making higher quality milk , Doak and Williams discovered , is in the cows Jerseys and Guernseys whose milk innately has higher amounts of protein , electrolytes , calcium and carbohydrates than the milk we typically buy in stores . Store milk is produced primarily by Holsteins , which comprise 90 percent of the herds in the U.S. simply because they produce more milk per cow.It went on to claim : Jerseys naturally produce the highest quality milk for human consumption , said Erick Metzger , general manager of National All-Jersey Inc. , an industry group . Compared to average milk , a glass of Jersey milk has greater nutritional value . Nutrient-dense Jersey milk tastes better because there are more non-fat solids , protein and calcium in Jersey milk when compared with other breeds . The University was forced to retract the study , refunding the $ 228,910 it received from Fifth Quarters and other milk producers , to conduct what Professor Shim described as a $ 100,000 research project.On Friday , the University announced the results of the school s internal investigation into the project.As CBS News reports here , the University s investigation found a concerning lack of understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research at all levels of the process . You don t say ? The University of Maryland s chocolate-milk-cures-concussions research is likely to go down in history as some of the worst corporate-funded pseudo-science of our time.The lack of ethics applied by researchers in this specific study are glaringly apparent , even to the most casual observer.The real concern is that this type of corporate-funded research is taking place more and more often in the United States . Fossil fuel companies pay big money to any researcher willing to deny climate change or demonstrate how safe fracking is.The pharmaceutical industry funds the research that determines whether or not the products it markets to consumers are safe , while Biotech corporations fund research into the safety of GMO . The list of industries buying science goes on and on.While we often hear that all this corporate money flowing into America s colleges and universities doesn t influence research , the Fifth Quarters study shows otherwise .

       " \"Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery . He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used . They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC . The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this : Rod Wheeler : Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gon na say this right now . I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right .. to get involved . I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich ? The police department did not call me back because someone , a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department , they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know , why was I snooping around ? The plot thickens in this case . Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it ? IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE : CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL : SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist , Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To Stand Down On Case [ VIDEO ] Wow ! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence . It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . Now that this new information has been made available to the public , will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death ? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence ? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump ? Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death , FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler , a private investigator hired by the Rich family , suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now , questions have been raised on why D.C. police , the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months , have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler , a former D.C. police homicide detective , is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder . He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation . The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming , said Wheeler . They haven t been cooperating at all . I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer , which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI . I have been told both . When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks , he said , Absolutely . Yeah . That s confirmed . Wheeler also told us , I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said , Rod , we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you . Now , that is highly unusual for a murder investigation , especially from a police department . Again , I don t think it comes from the chief s office , but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [ Tuesday ] .The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington , D.C. , street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks , law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder , said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen , a now-deceased American investigative reporter , documentary filmmaker , and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time . FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election : Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange ( and his closest friend in London ) , to WikiLeaks ' Sarah Harrison , Joseph Farrell and many others . WikiLeaks ( @ wikileaks ) October 23 , 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks , the federal investigator told Fox News , confirming the MacFadyen connection . He said the emails are in possession of the FBI , while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler , a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case . Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours , but was not robbed . My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks , Wheeler said . I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters . The federal investigator , who requested anonymity , said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders , spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016 , were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21 . FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively . Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months . It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop : Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich . They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman , Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten , shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend . Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else . The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim , leaving behind his wallet , watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged Russian spy Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young ( according to Young ) .In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is Seth * * In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers . -h/t GP Here s the proof : Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @ GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @ robbin_young ( according to the latter ) https : //t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ WikiLeaks ( @ wikileaks ) April 8 , 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but , no one cared : https : //twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her , i m eager to find facts about seth , i m sure it wasn t just a robbery . seth was assassinated . : Guccifer 2.0 said , `` i 'm eager to find fact about seth , i 'm sure it was n't just a robbery . seth was assassinated . '' # SethRich Robbin Young ( @ Robbin_Young ) March 29 , 2017In June 2016 , the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers , lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered , including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to Guccifer , the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes . RTWhile Wikileaks Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger , he brought up the death of Seth Rich . Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation : Julian Assange : Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks . As a 27 year-old , works for the DNC , was shot in the back , murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter : That was just a robbery , I believe . Wasn t it ? Julian Assange : No . There s no finding . So I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below : Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death . He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC . His parents say he was , Making sure everyone who wanted to vote , had the opportunity : Shortly after the killing , Redditors and social media users were pursuing a lead saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning , apparently intending to speak to special agents about an ongoing court case possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently , Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest , with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance , where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump , and said that anyone within the Democrats organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers , Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders .

       " 'Things got a little heated during a press conference with President Obama in Japan on Thursday . The usually easygoing president snapped at a reporter who wanted to waste his time by asking about Hillary Clinton s emails.Obama told reporters that he was going to take one more question but when a member of the press asked him about Clinton he changed his mind , saying : You know I take it back I m not taking another question . We re in Japan , don t you have something to do with Asia that we want to talk about ? I ll be talking about this in Washington the whole time . I ve already said a lot on those issues I think these are better directed to the campaign . We don t blame the president for being annoyed . His trip to Japan was an historic trip as he became the only president to ever visit Hiroshima . The reporter could have asked him a number of questions about that , but instead chose to ask a question about a manufactured scandal . As if that weren t ridiculous enough , the press also asked him if he thought Clinton should release the text of her Wall Street speeches . Obama responded to that nonsense by saying : During the course of the primary , people say things that they think will help them get some votes , and once the campaign is over , they move on . The noise that is going back and forth between the candidates at this point if you want insights into how they re thinking about it , those [ questions ] should be directed to them . President Obama made it abundantly clear that he does not give a shit about all of the political drama going on .

       " 'Hillary is failing miserably with the young voters . In her wildest dreams , she couldn t have imagined running neck-and-neck with a 74 year old rumpled Socialist . More importantly , she couldn t have imagined Sanders would run away with the youth vote . Bernie Sanders has endeared throngs of young voters by offering taxpayer funded Free sh * t , but in the last few rounds of primary votes , it appears that isn t enough , as he continues to fall behind the candidate who is under FBI investigation . It sure makes one wonder what dirt Hillary is holding over Obama s head , as this recent shift of allegiance to team Hillary comes as a surprise to many . It s been pretty clear for the past seven years that there is no love lost between Barack and the Clinton s.In unusually candid remarks , President Obama privately told a group of Democratic donors last Friday that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was nearing the point at which his campaign against Hillary Clinton would end , and that the party must soon come together to back her.Mr . Obama acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was perceived to have weaknesses as a candidate , and that some Democrats did not view her as authentic.But he played down the importance of authenticity , noting that President George W. Bush whose record he ran aggressively against in 2008 was once praised for his authenticity.Mr . Obama made the remarks after reporters had left a fund-raising event in Austin , Tex. , for the Democratic National Committee . The comments were described by three people in the room for the event , all of whom were granted anonymity to describe a candid moment with the president . The comments were later confirmed by a White House official.Mr . Obama chose his words carefully , and did not explicitly call on Mr. Sanders to quit the race , according to those in the room . Still , those in attendance said in interviews that they took his comments as a signal to Mr. Sanders that perpetuating his campaign , which is now an uphill climb , could only help the Republicans recapture the White House.Mr . Obama s message came at a critical juncture for Mr. Sanders , who had just upset Mrs. Clinton in the Michigan primary and has been trying to convince Democrats that his campaign is not over , despite Mrs. Clinton s formidable lead in delegates . Via : NYT sSen . Bernard Sanders call for a political revolution has resonated with a growing segment of Democratic voters who are committed to his message but who , party leaders fear , will walk if he s not the eventual presidential nominee.Some of those voters tell pollsters they doubt they could support Hillary Clinton , Mr. Sanders chief competition for the party s nod , saying she s part of the very establishment the maverick Vermont senator is fighting against . Other Democrats say Mrs. Clinton would only earn their grudging support , leaving the party fearful of a catastrophic split . Via : Washington Times I don t think there s going to be a lot of change if Clinton wins , said Cronk , 21 . Like many younger voters , he s especially alarmed by income inequality , the issue that Sanders has made a centerpiece of his campaign . The Clintons don t really stand in that position very well.Clinton s weakness with younger voters has stood out consistently this year she lost Democratic primary voters who are aged 18 to 29 by 70 points in Iowa , 68 points in New Hampshire and 25 points on Super Tuesday , when she won seven of the 11 states in play for Democrats . Hillary s weakness with millennials has to be very worrisome for the Democratic Party , said Simon Rosenberg , president of the New Democrat Network , a center-left advocacy group . What you re seeing is the millennial generation has essentially seceded from the Democratic establishment . Obama s presidential campaigns showed the power of voters under 30 , who gave him 2-1 support in both 2008 and 2012 . In 2016 , even more millennials than Baby Boomers are eligible to vote , and they make up a large share of potential voters in battleground states such as Ohio , Pennsylvania and Iowa , demographers say.For months , Clinton tried to connect with younger voters through famous supporters such as singer Katy Perry and actor Lena Dunham . She embraced the anti-police-brutality movement Black Lives Matter , spearheaded by young African-Americans , and vowed to expand President Obama s deportation relief for young people in the country illegally and their families . She promised debt-free college for all , only to be one-upped by Sanders pledge of free college for all.Clinton has acknowledged she s fallen short , saying she has to work harder to convince young people she will help them . When an Iowa college student asked her in January why so many other youths found her dishonest , Clinton blamed decades of Republican attacks . Via : Florida Politics',\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO - The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism , five people briefed on the matter told Reuters . The program , “ Countering Violent Extremism , ” or CVE , would be changed to “ Countering Islamic Extremism ” or “ Countering Radical Islamic Extremism , ” the sources said , and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States . MORE For hardline West Bank settlers , Jared Kushner 's their man Iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as Trump talks tough Republicans wrestle with effort to cut Obamacare Such a change would reflect Trump ’ s election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase “ radical Islam ” in describing it . Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries . The CVE program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Facebook ( FB.O ) . Some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration , particularly after Trump issued an executive order last Friday temporarily blocking travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries . WATCH Uber CEO quits Trump advisory board Still , the CVE program , which focuses on U.S. residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online , has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective . A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus . In a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly , government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants , said the source , who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions . Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration , the money still may not go out the door , the source said , adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter . The department declined comment . The White House did not respond to a request for comment . Some Republicans in Congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective , asserting that singling out and using the term “ radical Islam ” as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts . Others counter that branding the problem as “ radical Islam ” would only serve to alienate more than three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully . Many community groups , meanwhile , had already been cautious about the program , partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement . Hoda Hawa , director of policy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council , said she was told last week by people within DHS that there was a push to refocus the CVE effort from tackling all violent ideology to only Islamist extremism . “ That is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion , ” she said . Another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a DHS official that a name change would take place . Three other sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized . The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort . In 2016 , Congress appropriated $ 10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13 , a week before Trump was inaugurated . Among those approved were local governments , city police departments , universities and non-profit organizations . In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic State ’ s recruitment in the United States , grants also went to Life After Hate , which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists . Just in the past two years , authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacist ’ s shooting rampage inside a historic African-American church in Charleston , South Carolina and Islamist militants for shootings and bombings in California , Florida and New York . One grant recipient , Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities , a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans , has declined a $ 500,000 DHS grant it had sought , according to an email the group sent that was seen by Reuters . A representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment . “ Given the current political climate and cause for concern , LAHC has chosen to decline the award , ” said the email , which was sent last Thursday , a day before Trump issued his immigration order , which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against Muslims while the White House said it was to “ to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals . ”\",\n",
       " 'This is a call to action You guys always talk about getting off the couch and doing something . How come things in our country doesn t change ? Well now s the time to stand up and make that stand and make your voices heard . The strangers carrying the whisper of danger arrived in the vast territory of the Harney Basin just before the holidays.Ammon Bundy once helped his father repulse the government in an armed showdown on a Nevada desert . He was Tasered for his effort.Ryan Payne checks guns at his Montana home in 2014 . The Army veteran created a national network of militia and recently moved to Burns to protest prosecution of a prominent ranching family . ( Cathrine L. Waters , Special to The Oregonian/OregonLive ) And not long ago , Jon Ritzheimer worried the FBI with his threatening rants against Muslims in Arizona and elsewhere.Now , the men say , they are in Burns to help Dwight and Steven Hammond.The Hammonds are father and son ranchers , due to report to federal prison on Monday . They were convicted in 2012 of arson for lighting public land on fire adjacent to their ranch land south of Burns . They have been imprisoned once and must return for an additional term after federal appellate judges said they had been illegally sentenced the first time.https : //youtu.be/9m2UpdOxmp0Self-styled patriots and militiamen gathering in Burns don t want that to happen , declaring the Hammonds imprisonment illegal under the U.S. Constitution.They have latched on to the Hammonds as their latest cause to stand against the federal government . I am here now trying to empower and motivate the people of this community to take a stand against tyranny and show them that I will gladly stand with them , Ritzheimer said.The Hammonds don t want to be part of the outsiders cause , and neither do many in Harney County.But that hasn t stopped the strangers from summoning help from militia groups across the country . They are vague about their intention and their plans , unsettling the community and putting law enforcement on edge . The militia plan a rally and a parade on Saturday , circling the county courthouse that houses the sheriff s office.The militia members have been insisting that Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward create a sanctuary so the Hammonds will be immune from surrendering . Ward met with the militiamen and rejected that demand . The militia has since labeled him an enemy of the people . Ward said he has received emailed death threats among thousands of messages from across the country regarding the Hammonds.Two weeks ago , Bundy and Payne roused 60 or so local citizens to their cause at a community meeting . They rented the Memorial Building at the fairgrounds for the night . They taped themselves lecturing the locals on their rights , on the Constitution , and on their duty to protect themselves.The Harney County situation is the second time this year Oregon has been the national rallying point for militias . Last spring , miners fighting with the Bureau of Land Management over paperwork outside Medford found themselves enveloped with militia defenders . The miners finally issued a plea for militia members to go home . The militiamen did but only after claiming they beat back the government . An administrative law judge temporarily stopped BLM action against the miners.But the activists carrying pocket editions of the Constitution with them to Harney County are better known for the spectacle in Nevada in spring 2014.Militiamen by the hundreds flowed to Nevada that year to help rancher Cliven Bundy . The BLM was corralling his cattle that it said were trespassing on public land . The agency said Bundy hadn t paid grazing fees for 20 years , amassing more than $ 1 million in bills.Payne , an Army veteran , came to the rancher s defense . In later interviews , Payne said he was the militia adviser to Bundy . Payne helped array armed civilians against the federal agents . We had counter-sniper positions on their sniper positions . We had at least one guy sometimes two guys per BLM agent in there , Payne told a Montana weekly , the Independent . If they made one wrong move , every single BLM agent in that camp would ve died . Ammon Bundy , Cliven Bundy s third son , was there too.As the nation watched , the BLM called off the cattle collection and withdrew in the face of the armed militia . The Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks hate groups across the country , said in a 2014 report on the Bundy standoff that the government s retreat empowered the militiamen.Ryan Lenz with the law center was on the ground in Nevada and later interviewed Payne for the report . Lenz said the Harney County development isn t surprising . What s happening is very much what everyone feared would happen in the aftermath of the Bundy standoff , Lenz said . The rule of law was suspended with the barrel of a gun . Bundy and Payne say they met with both Dwight and Susan Hammond at their home in November . Bundy said he helped the ranchers move cows one day.The Hammonds initially accepted the militia s offer of help to avoid prison , Bundy said . But the Hammonds changed their minds after being warned by federal prosecutors to stop communicating with the militia , Bundy wrote in a blog post.The Hammonds declined interview requests and didn t respond to written questions about their dealings with the militiamen . A Boise lawyer representing the Hammonds said in a letter to the sheriff that Bundy didn t speak for the ranchers and that they intended to surrender as required.Bundy and Payne and their associates are persisting , though . They explain in deliberate , calm tones their reasoning.The federal government claims title to most of the land in Harney County , the ninth largest county in the United States . Bundy and Payne maintain that Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution limits what the federal government can own , and that the government s claim to much of Harney County violates that limit . The federal government consequently has no authority to prosecute the Hammonds.Bundy and Payne , who said he has moved to Harney County , have pressed the matter on several fronts . They have insisted that Ward , the sheriff , protect the Hammonds . They have written other elected officials in the county and in Oregon asserting the same demand.Some residents have shown interest in the group s cause.Locals voted seven of their own onto a new Harney County Committee of Safety , including ranchers , a retired fire chief , and a tax preparer.Payne and Bundy said the committee would decide how to address the Hammond conflict . But Bundy quickly created a website for the group and drafted a sharply-worded letter to the sheriff for the committee to issue.Citizens on the committee said they authorized none of it.Chris Briels , Burns fire chief for 24 years , said he was intrigued by the constitutional arguments raised by Payne and Bundy . But he said he also felt pushed too hard by Bundy to act . Briels said he is no anarchist.The militia , Briels said , seems like a bunch of people ready to shoot . I don t want that in my county . Melodi Molt , a rancher and former president of Oregon CattleWomen , joined Briels on the new committee . She s troubled by what s happened to the Hammonds but also worried about what her community faces with the outsiders . We re not from the militia , said Molt . We re not going to come in with guns and overthrow the government . The state s largest agriculture associations have vigorously defended the Hammonds since they were charged but want no part of the brewing militia action . I don t think people lining up in front of them with weapons or any kind of threats are going to help the Hammonds at all , said Barry Bushue , Oregon Farm Bureau president.Billy Williams , Oregon s U.S. attorney , has also weighed in . In a lengthy statement to the Burns Times-Herald , Williams explained why the Hammonds were prosecuted . He then warned : Any criminal behavior contemplated by those who may object to the court s mandate that harms someone will not be tolerated and will result in serious consequences . Payne and Bundy say it s up to local residents what happens next . If the locals decide to declare the county a sanctuary for the Hammonds , the militia is ready . We re sending the message : We will protect you , Payne said.Via : Oregon Live',\n",
       " \"Up until recently , we ve all been witnessing Donald Trump speak freely with nothing really prepared except for the usual crumpled sheet of paper he d pull out of his coat pocket to read the latest poll numbers to tell us how wonderful he is . However , with clinching the Republican nomination getting closer and closer , he s trying ( and failing ) to be more refined . Which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him.During his foreign policy speech on Wednesday , it was painfully awkward to watch . You could hear him reading the speech , which did not come across naturally whatsoever . Watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark.Then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders , and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised . However , his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking.For example , he read : Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . But SAID : Our embassies in Kenya and Tan-ZANE-ia . Small blunder ? Sure , but one that was surely noticed by all and just another example of Trump s clear ineptitude.Donald Trump has a pretty interesting way of pronouncing Tanzania . # tanzaynia https : //t.co/2ygcnhCVKF DOPEITSTOM ( @ DOPEITSTOM ) April 27 , 2016Taking notice of this blunder was none other than , well , pretty much everyone- but also White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest .

Donald Trump is so deeply unpresidential in so many ways , it s hard to imagine we live in a country that would actually stoop so low as to elect him .

He s also right about his other point Donald Trump is the result of whitelash . It s the middle finger from white America for electing Barack Obama , and for daring to nominate Hillary Clinton .

       " 'WASHINGTON - Donald Trump will travel to Asia in November for the first time since becoming president , stopping in Japan , South Korea , China , Vietnam and the Philippines on a trip expected to be dominated by the North Korea nuclear threat . Joined by his wife Melania , Trump will travel Nov. 3-14 . His visit will include attending two major summits , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations conclave in the Philippines . Trump s attendance at the Manila summit had been in doubt until recent days , with officials saying he was reluctant to show support for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte , who has been responsible for a number of anti-American outbursts . A U.S. official said Asian leaders who met Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week helped persuade him to attend in unity with key Asian allies . An Asian diplomat welcomed Trump s decision to visit Manila because that reassures the region that Asia policy is not just about North Korea , it s about Southeast Asia as well . The diplomat said Trump s decision to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal early this year had raised questions about the administration s commitment to the region . But visits by senior officials , including the secretaries of state , defense and commerce , and Trump s planned trip , showed Washington intended to remain engaged . Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Duterte was looking forward to meeting Trump , adding that the relationship between the two countries was so resilient that ties would always recover , regardless of disagreements . Trump , who has been locked in an increasingly bitter war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , will have the opportunity to bolster allied resolve for what he calls the complete denuclearization of Pyongyang . He has denounced Kim as a rocket man on a suicide mission for test launches of ballistic missiles and for nuclear weapon tests . He has warned North Korea would face total devastation if it threatens the United States . Kim has blasted Trump as mentally deranged . The president s engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat and ensure the complete , verifiable , and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , the White House said in announcing the trip . Trump s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping . Trump has applied heavy pressure on China to rein in North Korea . While his efforts have had limited success thus far , he went out of his way to thank Xi on Tuesday for his efforts . I applaud China for breaking off all banking relationships with North Korea - something that people would have thought unthinkable even two months ago . I want to thank President Xi , Trump said at a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy . Speaking in Beijing , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told China s top diplomat State Councilor Yang Jiechi that the two presidents had established a very regular and close working relationship . Yang described Trump s visit as of great importance to the bilateral relationship . Let us concentrate on cooperation and properly manage our differences in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit , he said to Tillerson . At the same time , Trump s national security team is conducting a broad review of U.S. strategy toward China in search of ways to counter Chinese trade practices and open up market access , a senior administration official said . The United States also considers Chinese entities behind the theft of intellectual property and cyber attacks and wants to find ways to address these concerns , the official said . There was no definite timetable for concluding the review . We re looking at all of it , the official said .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Key senators said on Tuesday they are crafting a law that would allow states to use federal foster care funds to help opioid-addicted parents raise their infants . The senior Republican and Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee envision the law as part of a comprehensive effort to address the opioid crisis with increased prevention , treatment and law enforcement . “ Children and families are relying on us to take this important step , ” committee chairman Sen. Orin Hatch , a Republican of Utah , said during the hearing . The committee ’ s ranking Democrat , Ron Wyden of Oregon , cited a recent investigation , which documented 110 preventable deaths of infants sent home with opioid-addicted parents ill-prepared to care for them . One drug-dependent baby is born in the United States every 19 minutes , the series found . “ A parent ’ s drug addiction is becoming a growing reason for removing children from their homes and placing them in foster care , ” Wyden said . Hatch and Wyden described only the general scope of the bill they planned to introduce . They did not offer specifics for the “ Family First Act , ” but their staffers said the money would likely come from existing funds . Nancy Young , director of Children and Family Futures , which provides services to government welfare programs , testified that parental opioid use before and after birth places a profound strain on the foster care system . Shifting foster care funds to help parents cope with addiction will reduce costs , she said , in part because it will help keep mothers and infants together . “ We have the knowledge – we can no longer say we don ’ t know what to do , ” said Young , who cited statistics from the investigation to describe the scope of the crisis . Last month , responding to the report , a House committee overseeing child abuse opened an inquiry into whether the federal government is failing to enforce a federal law meant to protect thousands of babies born dependent on drugs each year . found that no more than nine states comply with a law that calls on hospitals to alert social workers whenever such a baby is born , and help them develop a “ plan of safe care. ” Federal health and drug officials have declined to comment and , according to a congressional staffer , have not responded to the House queries .',\n",
       " 'LONDON - Christine Keeler , the model and dancer whose liaisons with a British minister and a Soviet diplomat at the height of the Cold War shocked Britain and embroiled the government in a notorious political sex scandal , has died aged 75 . Keeler s relationship with married Minister of War John Profumo , whom she met , aged 19 , while swimming naked at the grand Buckinghamshire estate of his colleague William Astor , shocked socially conservative Britain in the early 1960s . Front-page revelations that she was also having an affair with a Soviet naval attache , Yevgeny Ivanov , titillated the public and shone a light on the social and sexual mores of Britain s secretive ruling establishment . Profumo was forced to resign after lying to parliament about their relationship . The political and diplomatic firestorm helped bring down the Conservative government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and the 1963 Profumo affair is still seen as a watershed moment that changed British attitudes to sex and class . Keeler s son , Seymour Platt , told The Guardian newspaper she had died on Tuesday night after suffering for months from a form of lung disease . She had led a humble lifestyle after the scandal but never escaped the notoriety it brought her . There was a lot of good around Chris s rather tragic life , because there was a family around her that loved her , Platt was quoted as saying . I think what happened to her back in the day was quite damaging . The black-and-white photograph of a naked Keeler sitting astride an Arne Jacobsen chair remains the defining image of the lurid scandal that has been retold several times on screen and stage , including as a musical . It even added an expression to the British lexicon . At the trial of Stephen Ward , the man who brought Keeler and Profumo together , a fellow showgirl was told that another establishment figure denied having sex with her . Well , he would , wouldn t he ? , responded Mandy Rice-Davies . In later life , Keeler had regrets about how the scandal unfolded and said she had been a victim . I wish , that at that time , I had been older so that I would have been able to have answered or spoke up for myself and Stephen but I was only a young girl , she said .',\n",

He could face up to life in prison if convicted.U.S . District Court Judge Anna Brown warned Bundy that it wasn t a particularly bright idea to represent himself , saying , The stakes here are extremely high . But Bundy was not dissuaded , he said that he was upset that his younger brother , Ammon Bundy , was told to let his lawyers speak for him during his hearing : I need to be able to speak when the time is right .I feel it very important that I need not be silenced when I need to be able to speak . The judge asked Bundy if he has any courtroom experience and he said he d represented himself before . However , the previous outcomes in those cases were not exactly favorable . As Oregon Live reported in January:2007 : Arrested on suspicion of interfering with a legal arrest . He waived his right to an attorney and demanded a jury trial , only to change his plea to no contest on the day of the scheduled trial . He was sentenced to six months of probation in November 2008 , ordered to take a life skills class and fined $ 500 , court records show.2011 : Found guilty of several vehicle-related citations , including an equipment violation and driving on a restricted license.2012 : Arrested on an allegation of misdemeanor theft . A judge ordered the charges to be dropped if Bundy fulfilled 18 months of probation.2014 : Charged with interfering with an animal officer . He pleaded no contest in April 2015 , but not before he was arrested on a failure-to-appear warrant . He ended up paying a $ 150 fine.If this case turns out like those , he s definitely going to prison for a long time .

See the comment from CNN below : The White House has been largely silent about the President s weekend activities in Bedminster . Members of the traveling press corps , which did not have access to the club , learned of the wedding visit when images started to appear on social media.Trump was to headline a private fundraiser at the club Sunday night for Rep. Tom MacArthur , R-New Jersey , before returning to Washington Sunday night . MacArthur found himself at the crux of the health care debate this spring when he proposed an amendment to the GOP health care plan that got enough conservatives on board to pass the measure .

       " 'UNITED NATIONS - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital , sparking a warning from Washington that it will take names . Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour said the General Assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for Trump s declaration to be withdrawn , which was vetoed by the United States in the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Monday . The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution , which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem . Mansour said on Monday he hoped there would be overwhelming support in the General Assembly for the resolution . Such a vote is non-binding , but carries political weight . U.S . Ambassador Nikki Haley , in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters , warned that the United States would remember those who voted for the resolution criticizing the U.S. decision . The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us . We will take note of each and every vote on this issue , Haley wrote . She echoed that call in a Twitter post : The U.S. will be taking names . Under a 1950 resolution , an emergency special session can be called for the General Assembly to consider a matter with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures if the Security Council fails to act . Only 10 such sessions have been convened , and the last time the General Assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on occupied East Jerusalem and Palestinian territories . Thursday s meeting will be a resumption of that session . Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital , generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington s Western allies . Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv . The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem . Haley said on Monday that the resolution was vetoed in the Security Council in defense of U.S. sovereignty and the U.S. role in the Middle East peace process . She criticized it as an insult to Washington and an embarrassment to council members . Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there . Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector , which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally .',\n",

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule . The people s president is a worker ! OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS ! OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump . He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry . You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow . It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it ! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure : When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants , Scott Pruitt sued . When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants , Scott Pruitt sued . And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges , Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010 , Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times . Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation , the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government . Besides air pollution , immigration and health care , Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking , contraception and endangered species . These days , whenever states go to court against the Obama administration , the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone . During Obama s presidency , the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general ( 27 at present ) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace . But Pruitt is at the center of the action . He has set up a first-in-the-nation federalism unit , which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more : Governing',\n",

       " 'VATICAN CITY - Callista Gingrich , wife of the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives , on Friday became U.S. ambassador to the Vatican , which is at odds with Washington over immigration , climate change and Jerusalem . Callista Gingrich , 51 , an author , documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide , presented her credentials to Pope Francis at the Vatican to officially assume her role . Her husband Newt Gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump . Newt Gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to Fox News from his new base in Rome . Trump s nomination of Callista Gingrich to the post at the Holy See in May caused some controversy because of her marriage to Gingrich , with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife . Both are Roman Catholic . On Thursday they attended the funeral at the Vatican of Cardinal Bernard Law , who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests . The pope has implicitly criticized Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change . He said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were perverse attitudes that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet . Francis is also opposed to Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital . The pontiff has called for respect for the city s status quo , saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts .. On Thursday at the United Nations , where the Vatican has permanent observer status , more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition . The U.S. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador looks forward to working with the Holy See to defend human rights , advance religious freedom , combat human trafficking , and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world .',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - A leading U.S. promoter of Latino boxing , All Star Boxing Inc , will give free television advertising space to Hispanic civic group Mi Familia Vota , which openly criticizes Donald Trump ’ s anti-immigration stance , in an effort to encourage Latino Americans to vote in November ’ s presidential election . The partnership will put the name and website of the group on signs in boxing ring corners and on T-shirts worn by the athletes on Spanish language network Telemundo ’ s Boxeo Telemundo program , starting at the end of June , officials at both organizations told Reuters . The partnership will be announced on Tuesday . “ Desperate times call for desperate measures , ” said Ruben De Jesus , the director of operations at Florida-based All Star Boxing , referring to this year ’ s presidential election . He said he decided to contact Mi Familia Vota with the offer of free advertising after hearing “ just the whole rhetoric with regards to the Hispanic community ” in the current election . He did not mention any candidate by name . “ Our platform is not to tell our Latino citizens who to vote for , but it ’ s important that this year especially we engage , ” he told in an interview , adding the free advertising space could reach as many as 5 million people . Ben Monterroso , the executive director of Mi Familia Vota , was blunter about the partnership ’ s aim . “ I think Mr. Donald Trump lives in another world , ” he said . “ In my experience working with the community , a big majority of the people that I talk to , they definitely don ’ t like what Donald Trump has done. ” Trump , the Republican who will likely face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election , launched his candidacy last year by calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration from Mexico , a country he said was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States . The wealthy New York businessman has also repeatedly vowed to build a wall along the border and force the Mexican government to pay for it if elected . More recently Trump angered Latinos by criticizing a federal judge overseeing a fraud trial against Trump University , calling the Indiana-born man a Mexican and , later , saying his Mexican heritage meant he couldn ’ t do his job properly . Trump has rejected accusations that his comments are racist and has said he is well-liked by Hispanics . A spokeswoman for Trump was not immediately available to comment . The partnership between All Star Boxing and Mi Familia Vota will begin on June 24 and run for four events this summer , then another four events after a brief hiatus , comprising 128 boxers in total , De Jesus said . Half the shows will take place in Florida and half in Mexico . The fighters will also hold local events in Florida to boost voter engagement in the critical swing state , De Jesus said . That could include visits to political events around Tampa and Orlando , such as helping to register voters . “ The boxers are coming out of their corners to fight for the community , ” Monterroso said . Boxeo Telemundo , with an over 25-year history , calls itself the most-watched Spanish-language boxing show in the United States . The show attracts an average 550,000 viewers weekly , especially among men 18 to 49 , De Jesus said . Mi Familia Vota is a non-profit , non-partisan group that works to register Latino voters and get Latinos involved in U.S. political life .',\n",
       " 'This latest Wikileaks email is evidence of more than just smoke where Hillary s concerned it places her in the middle of the fire . Will the FBI finally take the appropriate actions and give Hillary the same treatment every other American would receive , if they were caught in a major cover-up and the destruction of evidence while under subpoena ? With her hacker-friendly private email servers that appear to have been penetrated by foreign intelligence agencies , Clinton is now in the company of Aaron Burr , Bradley Manning , and Edward Snowden all of whom betrayed the public trust . The failure to hold her accountable is yet more proof that the Clintons are above the law . No matter what they do the legal system always treats them with kid gloves . FrontpageIn today s , 25th , Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails , one of the notable highlights is a March 2 , 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says On another matter .and not to sound like Lanny , but we are going to have to dump all those emails . The email , which may indicate intent , was sent just days before the NYT story revealing the existence of Hillary s email server , and Hillary s press conference addressing what was at the time , the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account , and server , in her home.Mills response : Think you just got your new nick name . It is unclear which Lanny is referred to : the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail , or , more likely Lanny Davis , special counsel to President Bill Clinton , and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues.Lanny Davis is the former special counsel for the Clinton White House and one of Clinton s most dogged public defenders . He also referred to the former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as nasty . ( So Trump apparently doesn t have the market on that word . ) When Clinton s team turned down an April invite from Fox News Sunday to defend her from allegations in Peter Schweitzer s book Clinton Cash , Davis stepped up to the plate , unflinching in his devoted defense of his old boss and his old boss s wife . He also took a co-starring role in the emails from her private server that the State Department has released , regularly offering obsequious praise and imploring her for favors.It is also unclear for now which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread , but Podesta adds : better to do so sooner than later . We can hope that a subsequent response , yet to be leaked by Wikileaks , will provide more color.This is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.The fact that Mrs. Clinton destroyed email evidence evidence subject to a congressional subpoena , no less is already evidence in itself that she obstructed justice through spoliation of evidence . Spoliation means you can take as evidence the fact that evidence has been destroyed . Courts are entitled to draw spoliation inferences and convict an accused person on that basis alone.And in a separate email sent out just days later by Clinton campaign communications director , Jennifer Palmieri , we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn t know Hillary was using a private email address : Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric . They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that . Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email , so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm . I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet s email addresses.Perhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin s emails , it can also take a repeat look at some of these , especially the ones involving POTUS.Via Zero Hedge',\n",

       " 'BEIJING - The United States hopes there will be some very good deliverables when President Donald Trump visits China , U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday , striking an upbeat tone amid trade tensions between the two countries . Trump will likely visit China in November as part of a trip that will take him to an Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) summit in the Philippines and an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Vietnam . China s relationship with the United States has been strained by the Trump administration s criticism of China s trade practices and by demands that Beijing do more to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons and missiles programs . Meeting in Beijing , Ross told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang he and his delegation had been greeted very warmly which augurs well for Trump s forthcoming trip to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping . We are looking forward to a very good session including a lot of American CEOs and we hope there will be some very good deliverables , Ross said , in comments in front of reporters . Li told Ross that the two countries common interests far outweighed their differences and their economic and trade relationship had enormously benefited both countries and the world . China is the world s largest developing country while the United States is the world s biggest developed country , Li said . In addition to that , China and the United States are the largest trading partners with each other , so I think it is fair to say that our common interests far outweigh our differences and divergences , he added . Over the years , economic and trade relations between our two countries have always served as a ballast for our overall bilateral relationship and also these important trade and economic relations have benefited enormously our two peoples as well as the whole world . State media quoted Li as further saying that China hopes the United States will give fair treatment to Chinese companies investments there , as well as ease restrictions on high-tech exports . Meeting earlier in the day , Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan told Ross that there was huge potential for cooperation and China was willing to manage and control disputes , the ministry said in a statement . China was willing to create good conditions for Trump s visit and ensure his trip was fruitful , Zhong added . Xi and Trump met for the first time in person at Trump s Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida in April . Trump has since played up his personal relationship with Xi , even when criticizing China over North Korea and trade . The two sides launched a 100-day economic plan at that meeting , including some industry-specific announcements such as the resumption of American beef sales in China . There has since been limited progress on trade relations . Ross s visit comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the United States and China following Trump s decision earlier this month to block a Chinese-backed private equity firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker . In August , Trump authorized an inquiry into China s alleged theft of intellectual property - the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing . During his campaign , Trump vowed repeatedly to declare China a currency manipulator once in office but in April backed off from that threat . Trump s administration has also repeatedly called on China to do more to rein in North Korea and has threatened new sanctions on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with Pyongyang . China says it is already doing all it can to pressure North Korea and that those countries directly involved in the stand-off on the peninsula should take responsibility for resolving tensions . There was no mention of North Korea in the comments Li and Ross made in front of reporters .',\n",

       " 'Dr. Christopher Driscoll , an Africana Studies program affiliate , is a perfect example of how academia uses religion to divide students along racial lines , which ironically only promotes division and hate A hip hop symposium recently inspired a professor at Lehigh University to develop a list of Cracka Commandments intended to help white people accommodate the imminent black spring . Christopher Driscoll , a visiting assistant professor of religious studies at the private university in Bethlehem , Penn. , posted the list of commandments last Friday following a lecture on the white appropriation of rap.According to Driscoll , his lecture led to a discussion about how white people fit into the # BlackLivesMatter movement and prompted a collaboration between himself , Lehigh Theater Professor Kashi Johnson , and hip hop artist Asheru . Together , we came up with these , the ten cracka commandments for 2015 , Driscoll wrote on his personal blog , Shades of White.Driscoll says the first commandment is : that all lives won t matter until # BlackLivesMatter which he describes as both a litmus test and the greatest commandment . The nine other commandments read as follows:1 . Always remember that white privilege is real , even if you do not understand it . Use it to convince other people that black lives , including black women s lives , matter.2 . Show up for protests , write letters to representatives , and start discussions with other white people about black lives mattering.3 . Always remember that ignorance is real , and is a product of privilege . Treat the ignorant with compassion , but hold them accountable . 4 . Never think that the critique does not apply to you . Just because you were at Barack s inauguration and your dad was a freedom rider , or because you are the head of your local chapter of GLADD , that does not mean you do not have more work to do on yourself , your family , and your community . 5 . Always remember that it is never a question of if violence , but whose violence are you going to defend . Unjust state-sanctioned and racist violence , or justified resistance ; the choice is yours , the choice is ours . 6 . Never tolerate racism from your friends or family . Whether it is coming from your eighteen-year-old friend , your thirty-one-year-old cousin , or your eighty-year-old grandmother , confront it always . Confronting racism does not mean you will lose your friend or family . It means you will help to make them act and think in less racist ways . 7 . You can not love cultural products without also loving the people who make those products . If you like black art or athletics , that appreciation is an entryway into recognizing that black lives matter . 8 . Never quote black leaders like Dr. King in order to criticize protesters and activists . 9 . Always embrace uncertainty . Life is uncertain ; death is certain . Uncertainty promotes life ; certainty produces death and destruction . 10 . Never put white fragility ahead of justice . If you are more concerned to argue that you aren t racist than you are with racism or with people dying , you re priorities are skewed . Do you want justice or comfort ? In addition to teaching , Driscoll recently penned the book White Lies : Race and Uncertainty in the Twilight of American Religion , which addresses the instabilities central to a white religion . Driscoll describes his personal website as designated for the progressive anti-racist ally and curious and frustrated , alike . Shades of White is a space for whites to clumsily , openly , and actively wrestle with a host of social issues that impact us , Driscoll states , adding that it is about time white folks come to terms with a problematic social arrangement that has seen them disproportionately advantaged for far too long . According to Driscoll , left-wing blogs do a good job of criticizing white folks on our failings albeit without offering concrete responses to meet the civic and social demands of everyone else . At the same time , Driscoll says right-wing blogs feel good , make us proud to be an American , but are often actively racist and sexist and sometimes , downright dumb . WATCH VIDEO FEATURING DR.

       " 'Iran is using the billions in cash resources provided under the landmark nuclear deal to engage in an unprecedented military buildup meant to transform the Islamic Republic s fighting force into an offensive juggernaut , according to a largely unreported announcement by Iranian military leaders that has sparked concern among U.S. national security insiders and sources on Capitol Hill.The shocking truth behind the US-Iran nuclear deal , as WSJ reports , is that John Kerry and the Obama Administration airlifted $ 1.7bn of cash in compromise payments ( read bribe ) to Tehran to ensure the release of 4 captured sailors coincidentally the same weekend as the signing of the nuclear deal.Wooden pallets stacked with euros , Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane , according to these officials . The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland , they said.Of course , senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange . They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental , not the result of any quid pro quo . Zero HedgeIt now appears that Obama s chickens are coming home to roost Iranian officials announced late last month that Iran s defense budget had increased by 145 percent under President Hassan Rouhani and that the military is moving forward with a massive restructuring effort aimed at making it a forward moving force , according to regional reports.Iranian leaders have stated since the Iran deal was enacted that they are using the massive amounts of cash released under the agreement to fund the purchase of new military equipment and other armaments . Iran also has pursued multi-million dollar arms deals with Russia since economic sanctions were nixed as part of the deal.Leading members of Congress and U.S. officials working on the Iran portfolio suspect that at least a portion of the Obama administration s $ 1.7 billion cash payment to Iran has been used to fund and support terrorists in the Middle East.The latest disclosure about Iran s military buildup is further fueling concerns that U.S. cash assets returned to the country which were released with no strings attached by the Obama administration are helping Iran pursue a more aggressive military stance against U.S. forces in the region . President Obama flat-out caved in to Iran when he handed them the disastrous nuclear deal and $ 1.7 billion in cash payments that could assist Iran s military , Rep. Sean Duffy ( R. , Wis. ) , an opponent of the nuclear deal , told the Washington Free Beacon . So it s no surprise that the world s lead sponsor of terrorism would feel emboldened to become more aggressive in the region and flex its military muscle . Iranian Brigadier General Kiumars Heidari announced the military buildup during Iran s annual Army Day . While the announcement did not grab many headlines in the Western media , national security insiders have been discussing the announcement for weeks , according to conversations with multiple sources.Iran s goal is to turn its army into an offensive force , a major shift from its historic role as a support agent for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps , or IRGC , Iran s extremely well funded primary fighting force.For entire story : Washington Free Beacon',\n",
       " 'Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage ( R-Of Course ) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office , but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night , during a town hall meeting , Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was one of the most offensive statements ever to come out of LePage s mouth and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem , LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting ( white ) Mainers hooked on heroin . It got worse from there . These are guys with the name D-Money , Smoothie , Shifty these types of guys they come from Connecticut and New York , they come up here , they sell their heroin , they go back home , LePage told a large crowd . Incidentally , half the time they impregnate a young , white girl before they leave , which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road . D-Money , Smoothie , Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist , LePage s long-suffering communication director , Peter Steele , said that this wasn t about race . He then gave the following word salad defense . The governor is not making comments about race . Race is irrelevant , Steele said . What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers . His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood , too . We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state . There are , might I say , just a few questions left unanswered here . Why did he use names like D-Money to refer to the types of guys who come into the state from Connecticut and New York ? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of gangsta name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer ? Why did he specifically mention young , white girls when describing the kind of girls D-Money likes to impregnate ? Does he have any proof that half the time out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women ? But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is ? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women ? Democrats have long complained about LePage , but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior . Some have even created a website called Get Right Maine , which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage , his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically . Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters , Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe , D-Skowhegan , said LePage created this situation with his own actions . We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration , said McCabe . Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us . We are committed to addressing the drug crisis , growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills . The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games . He just handed his haters which is , roughly , just about everyone he works with a ton of ammunition . Ever his own worst enemy , LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum , accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office , the better.Feature image via Flickr',\n",

       " 'America s Diner Denny s , has lived up to that title if you are looking at it in the context of how much racism exists in the nation . Henry Williams and Renee Hebert settled in a lawsuit against the company , that stemmed from an incident in 2014 when an L.A. Denny s forced them to prepay for their meal because they were ordering food while black.Williams was told by employees that he would have to hand over the cash in full to cover the meal before his group would be served . Clearly , a group of black individuals going to a restaurant is suspicious enough to assume a conspiracy to do the dine and dash is in the works . Surprisingly , Williams decided to actually hand over the money rather than take his business elsewhere . Maybe he really likes the Moons Over My Hammy meal.The ridiculousness of this was so bad , that even the Denny s manager eventually realized how bad his people screwed up and tried to return the money . The manager was so desperate to give the money back that Williams actually had to tell him to stop repeatedly coming over to their table to grovel and hand over the cash because he was being a nuisance . The manager kicked it up a notch by offering free dessert , to which Williams said he wanted to box his food and leave.Williams and Hebert said that nobody else was asked to pre-pay for their meal . In court , a customer that was seated nearby at the time testified that Williams and Hebert handled the situation well : They were black . I m white . I ve never been asked to prepay . I thought it was appalling for someone in that year and time to be discriminated against like that . Denny s tried to argue against the lawsuit because the customers order was a large one , and the location had other problems with people walking out on checks before . It got pretty damning , though , when the other customer testifying on behalf of Williams said that they had seen the restaurant targeting other black patrons to pre-pay in weeks prior . I bet not every case of these was a huge order . Denny s already had a bad reputation in this area , because it had to pay $ 54 million in 1994 for a case of similar discrimination against black customers.The details of the settlement were not disclosed , but it would be a safe bet that it was more than the cost of a dine-and-dash.Featured image from wikicommons',\n",

       " 'On Tuesday , President Obama s Veto Pen got some exercise when he dashed Republicans hopes of gutting clean water rules a curious mission , given the fact that Republicans in Michigan literally murdered 10 people and poisoned hundreds of kids with the state s disgusting water supply water their Governor assured them was safe to drink.The resolution , introduced by hog-castrating waste of flesh Joni Ernst , had one goal : to block the EPA s enforcement of the Clean Water Rule and to prevent similar measures from being taken to protect our nation s water in the future . Fortunately , President Obama stepped up to kill the GOP s dream of unregulated waterways teeming with dangerous bacteria and other nasty stuff . In his veto message , the President explained : I am returning herewith without my approval S.J . Res . 22 , a resolution that would nullify a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act . The rule , which is a product of extensive public involvement and years of work , is critical to our efforts to protect the Nation s waters and keep them clean ; is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress , industry , and community stakeholders ; and is consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.We must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our communities and the success of our businesses , agriculture , and energy development . As I have noted before , too many of our waters have been left vulnerable . Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers , lakes , reservoirs , and coastal waters near which most Americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water , recreation , and economic development . Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health . Because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water , I can not support it . I am therefore vetoing this resolution.Republicans attempted to use a rarely invoked law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn the rule , but the President s veto ended all that , as they lack the votes to overturn the President s decision . Ernst says that she intends to find other ways to curtail the EPA s ability to regulate our waterways . We all want clean water , Ernst said in a statement following the veto . This rule is not about clean water . Rather , it is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land . This is exactly why we need to vote BLUE in November do you think a Republican President would have protected America s water ? Featured image via White House',\n",

When I say the church : Christians . The church is healthy . We are the sinners . When responding to questions regarding German Cardinal Reinhard Marx , who suggested the Church apologize , Francis doubled down : I will repeat the same thing I said on the first trip . I will also repeat what the Catechism of the Catholic Church says : that [ gay people ] should not be discriminated against , that they have to be respected , pastorally accompanied . The matter is a person that has that condition [ and ] that has good will because they search for God . Who are we to judge them ? Francis , using anecdotes from his younger days in Argentina , praised the shift of acceptance , saying , The culture has changed and thank God ! Christians ; we must say we are sorry many times ; not only on this . These are the Pope s strongest words yet in favor of a broader acceptance of LGBTQ in the Church . As Republican lawmakers , many of whom are Catholic , continue down a generous and hateful road of bigotry and discrimination , the real Catholics ( including the leader of the church ) are standing firm against hatred and bigotry.Although not an endorsement of unions of love between same-sex couples , a big step in the right direction yet again no doubt .

       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of President Donald Trump s new strategy , which promises a far more confrontational approach to Tehran . Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers , choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it . He also promised to address Iran more broadly , including its support for extremist groups in the Middle East . Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway , a Defense Department spokesman , told the Pentagon was assessing the positioning of its forces as well as planning but offered few details . We are identifying new areas where we will work with allies to put pressure on the Iranian regime , neutralize its destabilizing influences , and constrain its aggressive power projection , particularly its support for terrorist groups and militants , he said . U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said his first goal would to talk with U.S. allies in Europe , the Middle East and elsewhere to gain a shared understanding of Iran s actions . Certainly we intend to dissuade them from shipping arms into places like Yemen and explosives into Bahrain and the other things they do with their surrogates , like Lebanese Hezbollah , Mattis said . The U.S. military has long been a strident critic of Iran , accusing it directly and indirectly of trying to undermine the United States and its allies , including in Iraq , Syria and Yemen . The tensions escalated in recent months in Syria , where American pilots shot down two Iranian-made drones this summer . Still , a more aggressive approach to Iran could trigger a backlash from Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and forces that it backs . That includes in Iraq , where U.S. troops are fighting Islamic State and trying to keep their distance from Shi ite militia aligned with Iran . U.S. forces in Iraq are quite exposed , and coalition forces are quite exposed to the risk of attack if Iranian elements so choose , said Jennifer Cafarella , lead intelligence planner at the Institute for the Study of War , a think-tank in Washington . The U.S. military is analyzing an explosively formed penetrator , or EFP , that killed an American soldier in Iraq this month . The reappearance of the device , which Iran-backed Shi ite militia routinely used to target American troops in Iraq before their withdrawal in 2011 , has startled U.S. officials . CIA Director Mike Pompeo noted the device was detonated in an area controlled by a militia backed by Tehran . We do not have evidence of a direct link to Iran , but we are closely examining this tragic incident , Pompeo said on Wednesday . Cafarella said the killing of the U.S. soldier may have been a warning from Iran . I think it is possible that the Iranians have been attempting to signal their commitment to retaliate against the U.S. strategy , she said . Mattis said the United States was watching for any new provocations from Iran . Asked whether he thought Tehran might retaliate , he said : It would be ill advised for them to attack us . has previously reported that options to increase pressure on Iran include more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments , such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen , It could also direct U.S. naval forces to react more forcefully when harassed by armed IRGC speed boats . The Pentagon on Friday detailed a series of major concern about Iran , including its ballistic missile development and cyber attacks against the United States and U.S. allies . The Pentagon promised to review U.S. security cooperation activities with allies in the region , something that could lead to alterations in U.S. arms sales and military exercises . It also signaled a willingness to re-examine the positioning of the roughly 70,000 American troops the Pentagon says are stationed in the Middle East . Still , Mattis said : Right now we are not changing our posture .',\n",
       " 'LONDON - U.S. President Donald Trump has re-tweeted anti-Islam videos originally posted by Jayda Fransen , a leader of a far-right British party convicted earlier in November of abusing a Muslim woman . Fransen is deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Britain First group . Here are some details about her organization : Britain First was founded in 2011 by leader Paul Golding with a membership of three individuals . It describes itself as a patriotic political party and street movement , although critics denounce it as a far-right , racist organization . Britain First is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage , traditions , customs and values , it says on its website . It wants to deport all illegal immigrants , halt all further immigration , and introduce a comprehensive ban on the religion of Islam with headscarves being outlawed in public . Anyone found to be promoting the ideology of Islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment , its policy platform states . It holds protests across the country , usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most , many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues Christianity in Britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant Islam . Golding was a former senior figure in the far-right British National Party and was elected a local councillor in 2009 . In his biography on the group s website it says he was sent to prison in 2016 for confronting a Muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying it s okay for Muslims to keep sex slaves . Golding stood for election as London mayor in May 2016 , winning 31,372 votes , 1.2 percent of all cast . Fransen , who was elected deputy leader in 2014 , was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2017 , and both she and Golding are facing further similar charges . The group gained prominence in June 2016 when Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot dead on the street by a Nazi-obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting Britain first during the attack . Fransen told the killer had nothing to do with her group .',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - Republican lawmakers and the Federal Reserve may be ready to strike a compromise deal on legislation that would give Congress greater scrutiny over the central bank , now that there is no longer the threat of a presidential veto , but it would likely stop short of dictating rules on setting interest rates . Donald Trump ’ s victory in the presidential election will give the Republicans control over both the White House as well as both houses of Congress next month , removing a likely veto on legislation to overhaul governance of the Fed by a Democratic president . Even so , Republicans will need support from Senate Democrats now that their Senate majority has shrunk to a 52-48 split in the November polls . Republicans who have been pushing for limits on the Fed ’ s ability to decide policy believe the central bank has overstepped its mandate by using extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy since the financial crisis , and they say reforms are a priority next year . Interviews with lawmakers , aides and top Fed officials indicate there could be common ground for a deal , marking a possible departure from the central bank ’ s resolute opposition to reform . “ There are different paths to a workable solution , ” said Representative Bill Huizenga , a Republican who chairs the House of Representatives subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade . Huizenga , who last year introduced legislation to tie policy decisions to a benchmark rule or risk “ audits ” by a congressional watchdog , told that he was “ open to what exactly ” the audits would look like . “ But it needs to be early , if not the first thing that we do. ” The Trump administration and the Federal Reserve declined to comment on the potential for legislation or their positions . Huizenga ’ s bill last year would force the Fed to operate under a directive rule like the one named after conservative economist John Taylor , which prescribes interest rates based on levels of inflation , employment and growth . That would be a sea change from the way the Fed has long operated , in which it reviews economic conditions as it weighs decisions on interest rates , but is free to set policy as it deems appropriate . The bill would leave room for discretion but would open the door for Congress to launch real-time reviews of rate decisions if the central bank strayed too far from the rule , something Fed Chair Janet Yellen called a “ grave mistake ” that would damage the bank ’ s credibility and distract its focus on longer term economic goals . Under a strict Taylor rule , the key federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend money to other banks on an overnight basis - would be one to two percentage points higher now than it is , based on calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland . Huizenga ’ s proposal is now part of a broader bill championed by Jeb Hensarling , the influential Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee , to winnow back financial regulations . Hensarling has called Fed reform a top priority and said he was willing to negotiate . Because any such legislation would typically require a supermajority to pass the Senate , Republicans - who now hold only a simple majority - will need to compromise in order to win the support of some Democrats . The Fed could find other ways to satisfy demands for more insight . It could use its existing semi-annual reports to Congress to cite an array of well-known monetary policy rules and explain how it arrived at its decisions with reference to those rules . That could provide the desired transparency and even side-step the threat of probes by a congressional watchdog . Another alternative would be to make these audits scheduled , and not ad hoc , which could help curb any partisan challenges to policy in real-time and preserve the Fed ’ s flexibility during crises . Still , those regular reviews would allow Congress to see how Federal Reserve policymakers sifted through economic data and forecasts to reach rate decisions . Now that the Fed has begun raising rates , Republicans complain it has offered a shifting set of reasons to move slowly , including political turmoil and market volatility overseas . A hint of how compromise could be achieved came this summer when the Cleveland Fed published a list of seven well-known policy rules and showed that their recommended rates varied between 0.14 percent and 3.08 percent . The Fed ’ s policy rate is now 0.25-0.5 percent and is expected to rise a quarter point this week . “ We do look at a number of rules ... but monetary policy isn ’ t a simple thing , ” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a recent interview . “ I hope that any change that Congress pushes through is done in a thoughtful way and doesn ’ t disrupt the benefits that we have in the current system. ” While there is no explicit reference to the Fed ’ s swollen balance sheet in proposed legislation , Hensarling and other critics have called for a firm plan to sell off the $ 3.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds the central bank amassed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis . The bond purchases were extraordinary measures taken to stimulate growth . Many Republican lawmakers say bond purchases inappropriately increases the Fed ’ s role in the economy and amounts to financing of the government , a measure that is banned under statutes . Critics say the Fed ’ s plan to shed assets once interest rates have started normalizing is too vague , suggesting that could work its way into increased congressional oversight . The Fed maintains that its policies have been transparent in the face of a deep recession and frustratingly slow recovery . Yellen and her colleagues also say the Fed can best achieve its twin mandate of price stability , which it targets at 2 percent inflation , and maximum sustainable employment when free of short-term political interference . It is close to both goals now . Taken together , Republicans ’ pursuit of reforms makes future Fed policy “ a big global uncertainty , ” said Peter Hooper , a former Fed official who is chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities . It could lead to more aggressive rate hikes than the roughly two-per-year currently expected , and quicker trimming of the balance sheet , he said . Selling bonds , or even halting purchases of those maturing , would raise market yields and amount to tighter monetary conditions . Getting a Fed-reform bill into Trump ’ s hands “ will require a consensus , ” said Representative Frank Lucas , another Republican on the House Monetary Policy subcommittee . “ To get there we would need to explain to the Senate that this would not constrain the Fed in any future crisis. ” Lucas acknowledged concerns that the Taylor rule would “ dramatically alter ” the Fed ’ s flexibility , and told his staff was considering possible adjustments to proposed bills . That would appear to be something Huizenga could live with . “ They are already doing the analysis , so maybe it ’ s asking them to share that analysis , ” Huizenga told Reuters , adding he hoped the election of Trump caused Fed leadership to “ rethink its stiff-arming ” of reforms .',\n",

       " 'MANILA - Ride-hailing platforms Uber [ UBER.UL ] and Grab have agreed to stop their drivers from delivering unchecked packages on behalf of customers , in response to government concerns they could unwittingly become couriers of illegal drugs .

President Rodrigo Duterte s 15-month-old administration has been waging a brutal war on drugs , the centerpiece of his election campaign , with thousands of people killed during what police say are anti-narcotics operations .

       " 'LONDON - All four members of the British government s Social Mobility Commission have quit accusing Prime Minister Theresa May of being too fixated on Brexit to improve the prospects of those from poor backgrounds . May has said she would create an economy which works for all Britons , but the commission s chairman Alan Milburn , a former minister in Tony Blair s Labour government , said she was failing to deliver on her promises . I have reached the conclusion sadly that the current government bears little , if any , hope of progress being made toward the fairer Britain the prime minister has talked about , Milburn told the BBC on Sunday . The government for understandable reasons is focused on Brexit and seems to lack the bandwith to be able to translate the rhetoric of healing social division and promoting social justice into reality . May talked about tackling the burning injustices in society on her first day as prime minister last year . She talked about tackling racism , gender inequality , the underperformance of government schools and the difficulties young people face buying a home . A government spokesman said it was making good progress on social mobility . We accept there is more to do and that is why we are focusing our efforts in disadvantaged areas where we can make the biggest difference , the spokesman said . May , who presides over a warring cabinet and has faced an open rebellion by some of her own lawmakers , is being buffeted by crises . Two ministers have quit May s cabinet in the last month , placing a strain on the government ahead of the Dec. 14-15 summit on Britain s exit from the European Union , when Britain wants EU leaders to give a green light to talks about future trade relations . An opinion poll published for the Mail On Sunday newspaper put Labour on 45 percent with the ruling Conservatives on 37 percent , the biggest lead for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn s party in a survey by pollster Survation since late 2013 .

Corbyn has promised sweeping renationalisation , tax rises for the rich and increased welfare spending , including an end to healthcare cuts and scrapping university tuition fees .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Overuse of harsh sanctions like those deployed against Iran to limit its nuclear program risks driving business activity from the United States and a move away from the dollar as the world ’ s reserve currency , U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Wednesday . Sanctions have emerged as a favored policy tool of choice for the United States , which has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking , cyber attacks , jihadist financing , and Russian actions in Ukraine . The economic measures enable the U.S. government to blacklist people and organizations , banning U.S. and sometimes even foreign citizens from dealing with them and effectively barring them from the international financial system . For example , the United States was able to induce buyers of Iranian oil to sharply curtail their purchases , and international banks cut ties with Iran for fear of losing access to the U.S. financial system . Iran reached a deal with the United States and other world powers last July that lifted the harshest measures in return for curbs on its nuclear program . But “ sanctions overreach ” risks encouraging businesses to avoid the U.S. financial system and could erode the power of the U.S. dollar as the pre-eminent reserve currency , Lew said during a speech in Washington . “ The more we condition use of the dollar and our financial system on adherence to U.S. foreign policy , the more the risk of migration to other currencies and other financial systems in the medium-term grows , ” Lew said . In particular , so-called secondary sanctions should be wielded in the most “ exceptional ” circumstances , Lew said . Those measures bar even non-U.S. citizens from dealing with sanctioned individuals or companies , and were the type of sanctions levied against Iran . “ They are viewed even by some of our closest allies as extra-territorial attempts to apply U.S. foreign policy to the rest of the world , ” Lew said , adding that the Iran nuclear sanctions should not be viewed as a “ starting point ” for other sanctions programs . Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail have criticized the removal of sanctions on Iran , and legislators have tried to restrict President Barack Obama ’ s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear deal . But because Iran had “ kept its end of the deal , ” Lew said , the United States should uphold the sanctions relief it has promised . In recent weeks , Iranian leaders have complained that U.S. policies have forced major banks and corporations to stay away from Iran despite the formal lifting of sanctions in January .',\n",
       " 'SYDNEY - Papua New Guinean police cleared the remaining asylum-seekers from a shuttered Australian-run detention complex on Friday , ending a three-week protest which started with some 600 people surviving on rain water and smuggled food and supplies . Australia closed the Manus Island detention centre on Oct. 31 , after it was declared illegal by a Papua New Guinea court , but the asylum seekers refused to leave to transit centres saying they feared for their safety . Despite the unsanitary conditions and lack of adequate food and fresh water , about 300 remained when Papua New Guinea police started removing people on Thursday and Friday . The refugees are leaving the prison camp , Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani told in a text message on Friday . We did our best to send out our voice but the government does not care . Australia s Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement on Friday that all of the asylum seekers had now departed for alternative accommodation . Advocates should now desist from holding out false hope to these men that they will ever be brought to Australia , Dutton said . In Geneva , the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR denounced the use of force by Papua New Guinean police to remove the refugees and asylum seekers and called for Australia to ensure their protection . The beating of refugees and asylum-seekers by uniformed officers with metal poles , shown by footage released today , is both shocking and inexcusable , UNHCR said in a statement . Several refugees were severely injured in the raid and needed medical treatment , it added , warning of a grave risk of further deterioration of the situation on the island . The fate of the asylum seekers , some of whom have been detained for years and come mostly from Afghanistan , Iran , Myanmar , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Syria , remains unclear . Australia steadfastly refuses to allow them entry under its strict sovereign borders policy and the asylum seekers have refused to resettle in Papua New Guinea . Australia and Papua New Guinea both say the asylum seekers are now the other s responsibility , although the Australian government said it had spent A $ 10 million ( $ 7.6 million ) on the transit facility and it wanted the men to move there . Under Australia s sovereign borders policy asylum seekers trying to reach its shores by boat are intercepted and detained in either Papua New Guinea or Nauru in the South Pacific . The United Nations and human rights groups have for years criticised Australia s policy , citing human rights abuses in the offshore detention centres and called for their closure . Papua New Guinea intensified efforts to clear the Manus facility on Thursday by bringing in buses to start moving the men and cutting off routes previously used to deliver smuggled supplies , said Christian pastor Jarrod McKenna , who was at the shuttered centre earlier this week helping the refugees . Pictures sent to by an asylum-seeker showed Papua New Guinean officials wearing army fatigues inside the camp on Friday , and a video distributed by advocacy group GetUp showed police armed with sticks pulling an asylum seeker to his feet . Buses are waiting for you , trucks are waiting for you ... you will get on to them and you will move to your new location , you will not stay here , a man who identified himself as a police commander told the asylum seekers in a video posted to Facebook by Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz . Papua New Guinea immigration and police officials did not return telephone calls from to seek comment . ( $ 1 = 1.3118 Australian dollars )',\n",
       " 'DUBAI - A Western-backed Saudi-led coalition scored its first major gains in Yemen since former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed on Monday when local fighters captured an area on the Red Sea coast from Houthi rebels , residents said on Thursday . Saleh , who had made common cause with the Houthis after they captured the capital Sanaa in 2014 , switched sides in an announcement last week that plunged the country deeper into turmoil . Residents said southern Yemeni fighters and allied local forces captured al-Khoukha district located some 350 km ( 220 miles ) south-west of Sanaa after heavy fighting over Wednesday night which also involved coalition forces . Houthi forces control Sanaa and much of the rest of the impoverished country , where three years of war has killed more than 10,000 people and brought it to the verge of famine . Saleh had helped the Houthis win control of Sanaa and much of the north and his decision to abandon them had major implications on the battlefield . The Houthis crushed a pro-Saleh uprising in the capital and shot him dead in an attack on his convoy on December 4 . Saleh s body remained at a military hospital in Sanaa while the Houthis - who control the capital - and members of his party sparred over burial plans , sources close to the family said . The sources said the Houthis had demanded that Saleh s body be buried in a family ceremony at his home village of Sanhan , south of Sanaa , while the family was insisting that the Houthis hand over the body without any conditions . The Houthis said they had found stashes of gold and cash at Saleh s residence , which they had over-run and seized before his death on Monday , and confiscated it for the benefit of the state treasury . The group gave no details on the amount and the report could not independently be verified . U.N.-appointed investigators said in 2015 that Saleh was suspected of having corruptly amassed as much as $ 60 billion , equivalent to Yemen s annual GDP , during his 33 years in office . The U.S. and U.K.-backed Saudi-led coalition has stepped up air strikes on Yemen since Saleh s death as Houthi forces have tightened their grip on the capital . Residents said fighters known as the Southern Resistance , together with other local forces and backed by coalition advisers from the United Arab Emirates , launched attacks on al-Khoukha on Wednesday . At least 25 people from both sides were killed before Yemeni fighters captured the town of al-Khoukha and a small fishing port . A spokesman for the Houthi movement could not immediately be reached for comment . The Houthi-run Saba news agency has reported heavy air strikes by the coalition on Sanaa and in the Saada province in northern Yemen , but made no mention of any ground offensive in al-Khoukha area . Saba reported at least seven members of the same family killed in an air strike on their house in Nihem district outside Sanaa , including three children . It was not possible to independently verify the report . A Saudi-led coalition air strike on al-Khoukha in March killed at least 22 civilians . When Saleh switched sides he announced he was ready to end a nearly three-year-old war - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - if the Saudi-led coalition agreed to stop attacks on the country .',\n",
       " 'MONROVIA - Former Liberian warlord Prince Johnson has endorsed George Weah for president before a Nov. 7 run-off vote between the former soccer star and Vice President Joseph Boakai . The endorsement should help Weah , who won 38.4 percent of the vote in the first round this month , more than anyone else but shy of the 50.1 percent needed to win outright . It also puts pressure on Boakai to drum up support from other candidates . Johnson s endorsement of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2011 helped the Nobel Peace Prize winner get re-elected , though his influence has waned since then : he won 8 percent of votes this year , versus 11 percent in 2011 . I am humbled to announce ... my full and unflinching support in collaboration with the Congress for Democratic Change party of Senator George Weah , Prince Johnson said at his Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction party headquarters . The announcement follows two weeks of political wrangling , during which the two frontrunners from October s first round sought to gain support from a field of 18 other candidates . Weah is popular and famous , mainly because of his star performances for Italian and French football clubs during the 1990s . But he lacks political experience , and his policies to alleviate widespread poverty and chronic under-development are vague , making extra support vital . This is historic and we welcome that , said CDC chairman Wilson Tarpeh . Johnson is reading the writing on the wall . It tells you that the people of Liberia are tired of one-party rule . Johnson s attempt at playing kingmaker makes many in Liberia uncomfortable , given his role in the civil war that ended in 2003 . In 1990 , his band of troops took control of parts of the capital Monrovia to oust former president Samuel Doe , and he celebrated as the leader was executed . Still , his supporters are loyal and are expected to listen to his call to vote for Weah . Johnson s backing will not win the vote alone for Weah , but it will certainly boost his prospects , especially as other candidates are also likely to throw their weight behind the opposition leader , sensing his momentum , said Roddy Barclay , director at risk-advisory firm Africa Practice .',\n",
       " 'During Obama s 8 years in office , he took a passive approach to the aggressive and unhinged North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un . At the end of his time in office , Obama had to admit that his approach with them didn t work . President Trump however , is not Barack Obama , and has chosen a different course of action . He s not about to sit back and ignore North Korea s crazy dictator , as he continues to threaten the United States.CNS News President Obama , speaking at his final news conference in Laos , said his approach to North Korea is to not reward bad behavior , but he also admitted that his approach isn t working because Pyongyang has continued to engage in the development of their nuclear program . Obama spoke shortly before North Korea conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test.Obama said he is deeply disturbed by North Korea s continued flouting of international obligations , and he pointed to the defensive measures the deployment of U.S. THADD missiles in South Korea intended to protect the U.S. and its allies.North Korea upped its warmongering with Donald Trump today in a series of menacing boasts threatening to ravage US troops amid fears the two countries are heading for war.The secretive state vowed to pulverize US bases and South Korean capital Seoul if it was threatened by the US military , which is carrying out drills on the Korean peninsula . A US aircraft carrier group is steaming towards the region.It claimed it would ruthlessly ravage the US if Washington attacked . China warned the region could go to war at any moment .The rhetoric comes after North Korea warned that President Donald Trump s troublemaking and aggressive tweets have pushed the world to the brink of thermo-nuclear war.Pyongyang s Vice Minister Han Song Ryol accused Trump of building up a vicious cycle of tensions and warned the US against provoking North Korea militarily . He said : We will go to war if they choose . He added the country would continue developing its nuclear program and conduct its next nuclear test whenever its leaders see fit.In the past week Trump has shown his willingness to launch military strikes , with US missiles deployed in Syria and Afghanistan.In other developments today , as tensions heighten in the Korean peninsula : Pence plans to celebrate Easter with US and Korean troops on Sunday before talks on Monday with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn . We re going to consult with the Republic of Korea on North Korea s efforts to advance its ballistic missile and its nuclear program , a White House foreign policy adviser told reporters , previewing Pence s trip.Pence will land in Seoul the day after North Korea s biggest national day , the Day of the Sun . The White House has contingency plans for Pence s trip should it coincide with a another North Korean nuclear test by its leader Kim Jong Un , the adviser said . Unfortunately , it s not a new surprise for us . He continues to develop this program , he continues to launch missiles into the Sea of Japan , the adviser said . With the regime it s not a matter of if it s when . We are well prepared to counter that , the adviser said.U.S . officials have played down the prospect of any military strike against North Korea , which would likely provoke massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.China , North Korea s sole major ally and neighbor , opposes its weapons program and has called for talks leading to a peaceful resolution and the denuclearization of the peninsula . Military force can not resolve the issue , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing . Amid tensions we will also find a kind of opportunity to return to talks . Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also underscored fears about possible threats from North Korea , telling parliament in Tokyo that Pyongyang could have the capacity to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas.CIA director Mike Pompeo said North Korea was closer now than it had ever been to being able to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental missile and increased its technical know-how with each new test.Experts do not believe North Korea has a deliverable long-range nuclear weapon , or intercontinental missiles.But that could change within the next few years , as experts say North Korea could have a viable nuclear warhead and a ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland during Trump s watch as president.Aerial photos taken Tuesday show continued activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear site where US officials fear a nuclear device has been installed in a tunnel ahead of another test.And Han , referring to North Korea as the Democratic People s Republic of Korea , said Friday : If the US comes with reckless military maneuvers then we will confront it with the DPRK s preemptive strike . We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands , and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. preemptive strike . The message had been echoed in the days before , when North Korea said it would launch a merciless retaliatory strike against US military action.Pyongyang also recently launched a ballistic missile and some experts say it could conduct another nuclear test at virtually anytime.For entire story : Daily Mail',\n",
       " 'New Mexico Republicans are resorting to intimidation tactics to scare voters into voting for Donald Trump.The Republican Party is literally sending out flyers to people across the state warning them that if they don t vote GOP on Election Day they will tattle on them to their neighbors and make life more difficult for them.According to the Daily Beast , The mailer shows a woman in a cold blue hue peeking through her blinds . When the Democrats win the election and you didn t do your part your neighbors will know , it reads , in all caps.The back shows a map of houses , some tagged with red check marks in blue pinpoints . Do your part in this election , it says . After all , voting is a matter of public record . While whether you voted or not is a matter of public record , who or what party you voted for is not . Obtaining and using such information to threaten voters is election fraud and voter intimidation , both of which are federal crimes.18 U.S , Code 594 states , Whoever intimidates , threatens , coerces , or attempts to intimidate , threaten , or coerce , any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year , or both.And a spokesman for the New Mexico GOP admitted that the party sent out the flyer , thus admitting to committing a crime . But when further questioned about the flyer , W. Tucker Keene hung up on the The Daily Beast.While Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to cry about election fraud , their own party is committing that very crime in New Mexico . The question is do they have a problem with that or do they only care about non-existent election fraud that Democrats are supposedly going to commit ? Because not having a problem with real election fraud just because it is perpetrated by Republicans would make them hypocrites.By outing people who vote Democrat , the New Mexico GOP would be putting Americans in danger of being persecuted or worse just because they voted a certain way.Sending out a mailer with the intent to intimidate voters is illegal and the New Mexico GOP should be under investigation by the Department of Justice . This is an outrageous dirty tactic and there needs to be serious consequences.Featured Image : Daily Beast',\n",

       " 'Is anyone else concerned that the Left was able to turn the display of a Confederate flag by an American into a criminal offense almost overnight ? When a contractor s truck at the University of Wisconsin LaCrosse sported a Confederate flag across its grille in November , one official was quick to condemn the contractor , call for the flag s removal , and it turns out even asked for an informal police investigation into the matter . E-mails obtained by the LaCrosse Tea Party show Paula Knudson , Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the school , went farther than previously known in her efforts to get the flag removed and the contractor punished.LaCrosse confederate flagUpon learning of the flag s presence on campus , Knudson e-mailed Doug Pearson , the head of Facilities Planning and Management for the school , to ask that the contractor be told the flag needed to go . The contractor quickly and willingly complied and Knudson went on to e-mail the entire UWL campus students and faculty to express her regret over the incident and say that she was personally . . . offended and . . . very sorry for the fear and angst caused by its presence . [ Emphasis added ] At the same time , e-mails reveal , Knudson e-mailed pictures of the truck to interim UW-LaCrosse Police Chief Scott McCullough with the subject line License please ? After reading Knudson s campus-wide missive , McCullough responded to say he read her e-mail to mean that there was no longer any need for police action since the flag had been removed.McCullough also went on to reference another incident with yet another truck that displayed the Confederate flag and urged Knudson to remember that the police can not run license plate numbers without a valid excuse to investigate the vehicle . I would like to take a second and make clear that like the last truck with this emblem , I would need to be conducting a police investigation into some violation ( I believe it was harassment last time ) before I can run this plate , he wrote . It could be literally only seconds talking with a complainant but it is an important protection to all of us that even the police can not simply run records checks for no reason , he went on to say . Please don t take this as any hesitation on our part to help just that we have very specific rules that we ( the police ) need to follow . At least two students who were offended by the flag took action on their own and approached the construction site to express their indignation according to an e-mail from facilities chief Pearson . The job site superintendent was concerned about two students who walked into the job site and confronted the trucker , Pearson wrote in an e-mail to Knudson that included UWL Chancellor Joe Gow . The superintendent indicated they [ the students ] were rude and were baiting the trucker to say something . I can help resolve these issues , but staff and students should not be walking into a job site without proper personal protective equipment . The following day , Chancellor Gow e-mailed Knudson to chide her for how she handled the situation . He urged her to point out the trucker kindly complied with the school s request that the flag be removed . We need to refute the notion that we have somehow banned display of the confederate flag , because we don t have the legal authority to do so . And we wouldn t want to stifle free expression no matter how uncomfortable it might make us feel [ emphasis added ] , Gow concluded.In public statements made after Media Trackers first broke the news of the incident and published a picture of the truck , Gow said the Confederate flag clearly is a racist symbol , but acknowledged that UWL would have allowed the trucker to continue to display it had he refused to remove it .

       " 'HAVANA - Opponents of the Cuban government are putting forward an unprecedented number of candidates for municipal elections in late October , the first step in a process to select a new president after nearly 60 years of the Castro brothers rule . The electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the Caribbean nation as the Castros revolutionary generation dies off , an economic reform program appears stalled , aid from key ally Venezuela shrinks , and the Trump administration threatens . The municipal vote , the only part of the electoral process with direct participation by ordinary Cubans , is expected to attract 35,000 candidates for the island s 168 municipal assemblies . It will be followed by provincial and national assembly elections in which candidates are selected from slates by commissions . The new national assembly will in late February select a successor to President Raul Castro , 86 , who has announced he will step aside after two terms . Raul , younger brother and successor to Fidel Castro who died in November , will retain a grip on power as head of the Communist Party , the only legal party in Cuba . The elections are being cast in state-run media as a show of support for the Castros 1959 revolution rather than an opportunity to debate the pressing issues . Campaigning is prohibited and candidates for the 12,515 ward delegate positions are nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits , not policy positions . They need not belong to the Communist Party and many candidates are independents but only few government opponents have ever competed . During the last election , the three dissidents nominated lost at the polls . This year , however , one coalition of opposition groups , Otro18 ( Other18 ) , says it is running more than 160 candidates in the municipal elections , demanding electoral reform and government transparency . This is unheard of , said Boris Gonzalez , 41 , one of the aspiring Otro18 candidates , explaining they wanted to challenge the Communist Party from within the system . Otro18 spokesman Manuel Cuesta Morua said in an interview that its candidates had faced harassment and threats by state security forces for months and had been warned not to participate . The government has not responded to these accusations . The Communist Party says it does not intervene in the elections , but a video circulating on social media of First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel , Raul Castro s probable successor , suggested otherwise . There are six initiatives for the 2018 elections that seek to propose counter-revolutionaries as candidates , Diaz-Canel told Communist Party cadres in the video . We are taking steps to discredit all that . In this battle , which we are already fighting , we are going to be involved in this whole process in the second half of the year , he said . The government has not commented on the video . Cuba brands all dissenters as mercenaries funded by foreign governments and exiles , out to topple the government . Even if a few dissident candidates beat the odds and are elected to municipal assemblies , they have little chance of getting any further . The candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the trade union federation and Committees in Defense of the Revolution . The slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections . Up to 50 percent of those names must be ward delegates . After the general election , the assemblies elect their respective executives and on Feb. 24 the new National Assembly is scheduled to name a new president and other members of the Council of State . I have never voted for anyone important , not even our president , said retired air force mechanic and staunch Castro-supporter Eduardo , who requested his last name not be used . I can only vote for my neighborhood representative and they never go anywhere , he said , but I still think it s a better system than one based on money and lies .',\n",
       " 'Randy Johnson 21st Century WireDigital technology has increasingly and exponentially become a part of our lives . Virtual worlds and reality , as humanity has known it to be for millennia , appear to be on ever-converging paths . Will humanity and digital reality be on a path of integration or a collision course ? While the direct application of Virtual Reality was difficult to see in everyday life following the 1992 Hollywood film Lawnmower Man , the reality of such technology is now coming into focus.Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality technology ( also interchangeably known as either AR/VR or VR/AR ) are ideas that have been hammered out in the digital sphere with regards to concepts and applications of use . Along with the steady advancement of digital computing power , an AR/VR future might better be portrayed in certain episodes of Black Mirror , such as Fifteen Million Merits or Playtest . Black Mirror s , Playtest : Season 4 , Episode 2 . A stare-down between perception and reality ( Image Source : Polygon ) The possibility and potential of the technology has made it a magnet for investment . There are profits to be made in this growing realm , and the implications of what these emerging technologies could do for ( and to ) humanity is staggering.So before delving into some current developments in AR/VR technology , let s take a quick look at historically new technologies which are now a part of our real world , everyday , lives : the smartphone and the motor vehicle.The Smartphone StratosphereOn one hand , the smart phone is merely synthetic material with touch screens and circuitry . Now in less than two decades , there are those whose daily lives are hindered without one . The attachment is almost as emotional as it is literal in some instances . Many need them to communicate , be entertained , figure out where they are , purchase products , or even socially interact with others or the avatars of others . To many teenagers across the world and Generation Y Millennials , the smartphone has always been there.It can be argued that society as a whole is becoming dependent and addicted to smartphones and other smart devices . In fact , with over 2.5 billion smartphone subscriptions world wide in 2016 , corporations and marketers are counting on it.Seeing a person interacting with any number of touch-screen devices does not garner much of a second look . Oftentimes , the person without the smart phone is the person who stands out in a crowd , as they are sometimes seen reading one of those archaic things we call a book . It is now commonplace that people can interact with thousands of different applications on countless versions of technological devices.Hooked : Not only can we take the physical work out of travel on mass-transit , we can also be oblivious to the journey along the way , as well as the work involved to make it all happen . ( Image Source : ne-asia.com ) After a few generations , many technologies simply become integrated as it were . They become a part of us and our day-to-day lives , and are a part of the real world.For comparative analysis , let s take a look at the evolution of another well-known technology , the motor vehicle From Engines to ElectricIn roughly 100 years , humanity has essentially integrated itself with motorized vehicle technology . The motor vehicle and all the industries that come with it , has shaped the world as we know it.Driving a vehicle , and everything that comes with it such as such as its design , manufacture , delivery , sale , gas and oil production , road ways , traffic laws , law enforcement , theft , accidents , smog , fighting over oil resources , etc. , has effected nearly everyone.The sales pitch and appeal of the motor vehicle have always gone together . From its early days , to current-day advertisements , automobiles have been marketed with the promise of freedom on the open road . In fact , the evolution of vehicular technology is a good indicator of how a specific type of technology can transform humanity in a very short amount of time . Technological Bliss : A promise of open roads and freedom ( Image Source : NBC.com ) The promise of anything good always seems to have a catch . Ease of movement with the automobile is not without its environmental impact . Without the automobile in particular , we would not have terms such as gridlock , traffic jam , or road rage for instance.Progress is not without its side effects . ( Image Source : kerma.wordpress.com ) The motor vehicle is a technology and a part of our world to such an extent that where we are dependent on it.The environmental and health concerns of gas and oil extraction and production , as well as geopolitical maneuvering and even warfare based on assumed resource scarcity , the deep infrastructure roots and dependence of commerce is in place . To stop the flow of motor vehicles , would inhibit the freedom of people to travel , commute to work , and utterly stop industry and commerce in its place.Electrically Re-energizing the AutomobileThe current slow-but-eventual transition from gasoline engines to hybrid or fully electric ones is just an evolution of the technology . While electric car technology is believed to have been discovered in the mid-1800 s , it has only recently made inroads to the industry on a potentially large scale with the Roadster by Tesla Motors.The Tesla Model S , has a 2017 manufacturer s suggested retail price ( MSRP ) of $ 69,200 dollars , while the most recent ( 2015 ) US Real Median Family Income was listed as $ 69,929.With the success of Tesla , the amount of established gas and oil engine automakers is lining up to diversify their portfolio for their consumers , is who s who list of the auto-industry . BMW , Chrysler-Fiat , Daimler ( Mercedes ) , Ford , General Motors , Honda , KIA , Mitsubishi , Nissan , Volkswagen , and Volvo , all have their own hybrid or electric car lines . After decades of profit , these industry giants can t wait to show the consumer that they too are environmentally conscious . Likewise , the consumer appears ready to accept guilt free and environmentally responsible driving as the electric car continues to improve , lowers in price , and becomes more widely available.Emerging Patterns : AR/VR technologyWith many integrated technologies in our lives such as smart devices or motor vehicles , if it feels like we ve seen this pattern before , it is because we have.First the technology is new . Next commercialism , industry , education systems , entertainment , pop culture , and the government , all conspire to get in on the action ; during this time , the race to integrate and capitalize on a technology in the name progress can induce a Gold Rush type of feeding frenzy . Then pre-established corporations are already pre-positioned , with the ready capital , assets , and resources to pounce on the next big thing . And finally , over a generation or so of different improvements and variations , it is hard to remember a world without said technology for those who inherit a world with it . Whether real or imagined it becomes a necessity.The likely integration of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality ( AR/VR ) into our daily lives will likely follow the same pattern as other technological advances . Similarly , with regards to forecasting its future integration in our lives , the saying follow the money applies.First though , what exactly is AR/VR as it is currently understood to be ? Augmented Reality ( AR ) uses the world around you , but a device introduces virtual items , characters , etc. , into the real world that a person interacts with . This is popularly seen with the downloadable application for smart phones , with the game Pok mon GO.Virtual Reality ( VR ) is the glasses/headset set-up where you are visually , and often audibly , immersed . Put on the glasses/headset , or similar gear such as Oculus Rift , or VIVE and you are in a whole virtual world.Both technologies are primed for upward momentum.Although economic forecasting has not always been an exact science , the monetary forecast for AR/VR technology seems to point upward.Business Wire notes : worldwide revenues for the augmented reality and virtual reality ( AR/VR ) market to reach $ 13.9 billion in 2017 , an increase of 130.5 % over the $ 6.1 billion spent in 2016 . AR/VR spending is expected to accelerate over the next several years , achieving a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 198.0 % over the 2015-2020 forecast period and totaling $ 143.3 billion in 2020 . It is important to note that the above figures are amounts projected to be spent by companies to further advance AR/VR technology . So the expectation for profit is most likely in the trillions.Does this sound far-fetched ? For a real world success story with regards to these emerging technologies in terms of profit , then Pok mon GO has been there , done that , and cashed the checks.By some estimates , Pok mon GO has made Niantic over 900 million dollars in 2016.Using Pok mon GO as a barometer of future profits , the potential is huge . Especially when you consider that in the ever-changing gaming world , many already considered outdated , requiring updates , fixes , and new features by many of it s users . If Pok mon GO calls it a career or not , the fortune has already been made.Virtual scavenger hunts are fun ! That kind of money has already inspired a similar styled brand-supported game in its early stages , called Snatch . Besides the puzzle and scavenger hunt aspects of Snatch , players will be immersed into an augmented reality with a commercialized , brand name , token-based , application where you can snatch items from other players to win prizes.If you do not fully get it perhaps the below video can help explain what it s all about.You heard it hear first ; if it hasn t happened already , playing Snatch is likely to start at least one physical , real world , fight over the potential of having a prize snatched by a player nearby.Immersion , Entertainment & InvestmentAll of the AR/VR technology is still finding its sea-legs so to speak and is still in transition with more immersive worlds . Along the way , AR/VR has been undergoing a natural progression and fusion with the gaming world . Gaming , and entertainment , appears to be the seductive gateway application for AR/VR technology development and profit potential.As games and game consoles have become more immersive over the years , it appears that AR/VR is expected to advance with it.The addictive element to immersive games is often literal in some cases as seen in the WebMD.com article Video Game Addiction No Fun : The lure of a fantasy world is especially pertinent to online role-playing games . These are games in which a player assumes the role of a fictional character and interacts with other players in a virtual world [ according to Kimberly Young , PsyD ] an intelligent child who is unpopular at school can become dominant in the game . The virtual life becomes more appealing than real life . Also , let there be little doubt that any psychological aspect of marketing to churn out profit will be used , as the video-gaming world is a 100 billion dollar industry globally . That s hardly child s play.The greater the entertainment immersion and the technological bliss , the bigger the hook to the consuming public will become . So despite a slow-yet-increasing public acclimatization with regards to AR/VR , investments keep pouring in.According to Digi-Capital , the investments for AR/VR start-ups in 2016 came in at a cool $ 2.3 billion dollars.These numbers for start-ups are in addition to previous acquisitions such as Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg s now famous $ 2 billion dollar purchase of Oculus Rift.Investments also include such companies as NextVR that can deliver live events in a VR format . The investors are a who s who of present day media empires in the United States.We see the following from nanalyze.com : Laguna Beach California startup NextVR has taken in $ 115 million in funding so far from investors that include Time Warner , Comcast , and The Madison Square Garden Company . In addition to these strategic investors , FOX Sports , Live Nation , NBC Sports , HBO/Golden Boy , Turner Sports , and CNN have all partnered with NextVR .The object for up-and-running companies like Next VR , or their investor Live Nation , is to bring entertainment events such as concerts or sporting events to the masses.In addition to the actual gate at a sporting event or concert of say , 50,000 people , you could also charge a virtual gate , if you will , for another million people who were never even there.Another company starting to make some real world profits is Utah s THE VOID . The company is in continually advancing their Dream Park in Utah . They have themed virtual reality ( or hyper reality as they refer to it ) type of experiences in New York and Dubai.Below is a trailer for their Ghostbusters hyper-reality experience in New York City.That s right you too can don a nuclear power pack and save New York from the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.To be fair , besides entertainment purposes , there will be benefits of AR/VR technology . Uses for design , training , and experimentation within a multitude of industries , science , and research and development , can all be enabled by VR . Medical students can practice on fake patients , soldiers can train in virtual combat with no casualties , researchers can get inside of a molecule , designers or architects can better visualize or display their concepts , and so on.For example , in April 2016 , the United Kingdom s Medical Realities used its product The Virtual Surgeon , which is a learning program developed for head mounted displays such as the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR . The live-stream was a first of its kind showing a live surgery allowing for a 360 degree view , and was witnessed live in places as far as China and Tunisia according to their site.Virtual Medicine ( Image Source : Medical Realities ) The other side of the AR/VR coinKeep in mind , however , that there this is likely a trade off for well-intentioned purposes realized by the implementation and advancement of AR/VR . These same advancements in AR/VR will also almost undoubtedly have profit , control , surveillance , and culture-shaping , as drivers for its very implementation and integration to our lives.AR/VR , like art , books , pamphlets , magazines , newspapers , graffiti , radio , television , and the internet , is a medium which can be utilized . With social norms , economies , and forms of government to influence the masses thrown into as variables , the acclimatization to AR/VR by society is likely to be many things to many people . Even today , we have News and Fake News . President ; not my President . Facts and Alternate Facts . All of these types of psychological shaping of reality could be further jammed into Virtual Reality.Even within education . Subjective topics , or viewpoints on historical events made to be realistic for experiential learning purposes could be abused . No different then a book or website , a VR lesson will have an author , a bias , and will be an area rife with the potential for politicization or propaganda infusion.Like motor vehicles or smart devices above , AR/VR also has society-changing potential . The possibilities for mass-level use , consumption , and integration of virtual technology could very well change our reality ; literally and figuratively ; shared and personal . The implications go beyond the industry and commercial implications of its use and delve into what makes us human and into what is real.We hear it all the time , but social engineering is what it sounds like . The direct implication of the phrase is that aspects of society can be engineered and designed towards a desired effect or result.The outcome desired for those at the top of our current power structures and institutions might entail use of technology to socially engineer with a nefarious slant : to conform the masses , infuse propaganda , create thoughtless compliance , and degrade critical thinking in favor of living a blissful other life , elsewhere in another digital reality.As the great celluloid philosopher , Morpheus , from the Hollywood blockbuster The Matrix , once pondered , What is real ? How do you define real ? If you re talking about what you can feel , what you can smell , what you can taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain . Might the world literally become whatever anyone wants to make of it ? Are we choosing for ourselves , or are we all merely like fish in the ocean being swept up unawares in a tide of social engineering ? A technologically controlled , artificial , designed , and immersive environment could possibly redefine reality , and what it means to be human along with it.READ MORE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY : 21st Century Wire Technology Files',\n",
       " 'ROME - The leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement , Luigi Di Maio , said on Monday that Italy should quit the euro zone unless it manages to change the bloc s rules on public finances . 5-Star , which leads in opinion polls ahead of an election expected in March , says if it wins power it will lobby Italy s EU partners to loosen the so-called Fiscal Compact which imposes steep budget cuts for high-debt countries like Italy . The maverick party threatens to hold a referendum on Italy s euro membership unless it is allowed to boost public investment and raise the budget deficit above the current limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product . Di Maio has recently softened the party s anti-euro rhetoric , saying 5-Star is pro-Europe and calling the euro referendum a last resort to be used only if Italy is unable to win any concessions . If we should arrive at the referendum , which for me is a last resort because first I want to go to Europe and try to change a series of rules ... it s clear that I would vote to leave , because it would mean Europe hasn t listened to us on anything he said in a television interview on Monday . But today I see an opportunity for Europe ( to reform ) , he told the private station La7 . Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi , the leader of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) , said in a tweet that this time Di Maio has been clear ... he would vote to leave the euro . I say it would be madness for the Italian economy . The PD , which has split under Renzi s leadership , lags 5-Star by some 4 percentage points in most opinion polls , but no party or coalition is seen winning an outright majority at the election , which is expected to result in a hung parliament .',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK - Former President Bill Clinton on Thursday faced down protesters angry at the impact his 1994 crime reforms have had on black Americans and defended the record of his wife , Hillary Clinton , who is relying on the support of black voters in her quest for the presidency . The former president spent more than 10 minutes confronting the protesters at a campaign rally in Philadelphia for his wife over criticisms that the crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in the imprisonment of black people . The Democratic race for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly heated as Hillary Clinton , stung by a string of losses in state contests , has traded barbs with her rival for the party ’ s nomination , U.S . Senator Bernie Sanders , over who is better prepared for the White House . In Philadelphia , several protesters heckled the former president mid-speech and held up signs , including one that read : “ CLINTON Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities. ” Video footage of Hillary Clinton defending the reforms in 1994 has been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the Black Lives Matter protest movement . In the footage , she calls young people in gangs “ super-predators ” who need to “ be brought to heel. ” Hillary Clinton , 68 , who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks , said in February she regretted her language . Bill Clinton , 69 , who was president from 1993 to 2001 , defended her 1994 remarks , which protesters say were racially insensitive , and suggested the protesters ’ anger was misplaced . “ I don ’ t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children , ” he said , shaking his finger at a heckler as Clinton supporters cheered , according to video of the event . “ Maybe you thought they were good citizens . She ( Hillary Clinton ) didn ’ t. ” “ You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter , ” he told a protester . “ Tell the truth. ” Hillary Clinton promised to end “ mass incarceration ” in the first major speech of her campaign last year . She has won the support of the majority of black voters in every state nominating contest so far , often by a landslide . Spokesmen for the campaign and Bill Clinton did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment . The United States has more people in prison than any other country . According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , 1.05 million prisoners were held in federal or state facilities in 1994 . By 2014 , it was 1.56 million . That year , 6 percent of all black men in their 30s were in prison , a rate six times higher than that of white men of the same age . Bill Clinton said last year that he regretted signing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law because it contributed to the high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes . On Thursday , he did not explicitly recant those regrets , but appeared to be angry at any suggestion the bill was wholly bad . The legislation imposed tougher sentences , put thousands more police on the streets and helped fund the building of extra prisons . It was known for its federal “ three strikes ” provision that sent violent offenders to prison for life . The bill was backed by congressional Republicans and hailed at the time as a success for Clinton . Although Clinton is popular among Democrats who view him as a gifted orator and crowd pleaser , he has in the past veered from the carefully calibrated message put out by his wife ’ s campaign , causing problems for her representatives . During Hillary Clinton ’ s failed 2008 presidential bid , civil rights leaders and high-ranking Democrats in Congress criticized the former president for statements he made during a heated campaign against then-U.S . Senator Barack Obama . Bill Clinton said Obama ’ s campaign had “ played the race card. ” Obama became the first U.S. black president in November that year . Bill Clinton ’ s remarks on Thursday drew criticism online . Some saw him as dismissive of the Black Lives Matter movement , a national outgrowth of anger over a string of encounters in which police officers killed unarmed black people . Johnetta Elzie , a civil rights activist , wrote online that Clinton “ can ’ t handle being confronted by his own record. ” “ This is like watching a robot malfunction , ” she wrote . Earlier in Philadelphia , Sanders , a U.S. senator from Vermont , assailed Clinton as unqualified to be president as the two campaigns became increasingly testy less than two weeks before New York ’ s nominating contest . “ Are you qualified to be president of the United States when you ’ re raising millions of dollars from Wall Street , an entity whose greed , recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy ? ” Sanders said at a news conference . Clinton this week sharply questioned Sanders ’ credentials and ability to carry out a campaign pledge to break up the big banks . Spokesmen for Clinton noted she never said the word “ unqualified ” when she questioned his preparedness for the presidency , but they declined to say whether she believed in that characterization . Clinton aimed for a more magnanimous tone than her aides when speaking to reporters during a subway ride in New York City . “ I don ’ t know why he ’ s saying that , ” she said of Sanders calling her unqualified . “ But I will take Bernie Sanders over Ted Cruz or Donald Trump any time , ” she said of the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination . Sanders returned the sentiment in an interview with the “ CBS Evening News ” later on Thursday . “ I think the idea of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for this country . I will do everything in my power and work as hard as I can to make sure that that does not happen , and if Secretary Clinton is the nominee , I will certainly support her , ” he said .',\n",
       " '- A man who accused former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert of sexual abuse filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the once powerful conservative politician owes him $ 1.8 million as a part of an agreement between them to compensate him for decades of pain and suffering . The plaintiff , identified as James Doe , filed the lawsuit in Kendall County Circuit Court in northeastern Illinois , claiming Hastert owes him the unpaid portion of a $ 3.5 million deal they verbally agreed to in 2008 . Doe said he was 14 when he was molested by Hastert , a trusted family friend , high school teacher and “ beloved coach ” of the state champion wrestling team in the town of Yorkville , Illinois . Hastert , 74 , pleaded guilty in October to a federal charge in Chicago federal court of “ structuring ” for evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in small increments . He was taking out the funds to make payments to a man identified in court documents by federal prosecutors as Individual A. Hastert is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday for the financial crime , and faces up to five years in prison although prosecutors have recommended a maximum of six months . Another Hastert accuser known as Individual D , and the sister of another accuser , who is deceased , are expected to testify at the sentencing hearing . Hastert ’ s attorney , Thomas Green , had no comment on the lawsuit , a spokeswoman said in an email . Court documents in Hastert ’ s trial revealed that he was accused of abusing five boys in the 1960s and 1970s , decades before he became one of the country ’ s most powerful politicians . Doe ’ s lawsuit claims Hastert sexually molested and abused him in a motel room while they were on a trip to a wrestling camp . “ For many years to follow , Plaintiff ( Doe ) suffered severe panic attacks which lead to periods of unemployment , career changes , bouts of depression , hospitalization , and psychiatric long-term treatment , ” the lawsuit said . Hastert admitted in his plea deal that he paid $ 1.7 million in cash , from June 2010 to December 2014 , to someone he had known for decades to compensate for past misconduct . Doe said in his lawsuit that he confronted Hastert in 2008 after learning that Hastert had sexually abused another person . Doe suggested $ 3.5 million when Hastert asked him how much would compensate him . Hastert agreed to pay the amount and asked for Doe to keep the agreement quiet , the lawsuit said .',\n",

Not that it was happening in the first place . Not that Trump fired the acting Attorney General shortly after she warned him that Flynn had lied . To Trump , the real issue is that we are finding out what is going on.Ironically , he seems to be unaware that one of his guests at the Mar-a-Lago snapped photos of the guy carrying the nuclear football and named him on social media or , of course , that all of his guests had a full view of secure documents as Trump perused them over dinner by the lights of his minions cell phone flashlights.Bannon & Flynn used phone flashlights for Trump read most secure N Korea docs w/waiters serving .

But as our demo showed , it s just as easy to compromise the camera , allowing the attacker to see whatever is in front of the phone , the publication s Russell Brandom writes in an article on the North Korea dinner debacle . That s usually not as useful , provided the target doesn t physically hold up the phone and point it at sensitive intelligence documents , but here we are .

He answers he is not protesting but is ( garbled . ) The Black officer says , You can do that anywhere . You can do that on You Tube . You can do that on Twitter . Why are you here ? Posobiec s response is garbled.The Black officer then demands , Do you have any weapons on you ? More back and forth and then the Black officer takes the Hillary sign from Polosiec and puts it on the ground and then orders his hands raised and put on his head and then to turn around.As the Black officer starts to search Polosiec he focuses on the photographer filming and orders his officers to search the photographer saying , You okay ? You wan na check him out too cuz he s like doing all the filming . Let s make sure he doesn t have anything on him . The Black officer orders the camera being taken out of the photographer s hands so he can be properly searched.The camera continues filming at ground level while police search and interrogate the photographer who after a while appears to sit down . Prosobiec can be seen a few feet away sitting down on the sidewalk being detained by officers.After eight minutes of being detained the Black officer says to Polosiec , You are perfectly within your rights but I d advise you to ( garbled ) but if you come back ( garbled , ) The lecture is hard to hear , but the Black officer claims he doesn t care about Polosiec s politics and warns him that someone might ( attack ) him over the sign and the that he wouldn t come back to save you .

       " 'NEW YORK - Donald Trump has said a lot of things that , were he a sitting U.S. president instead of a candidate for the job , could be expected to roil financial markets . If investors were taking the Republican presidential nominee at his word , they would be selling shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) , Mondelez International Inc ( MDLZ.O ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) , and cashing out of Mexican equities - all targets of Trump threats of boycotts , barrier walls or import taxes . Investors betting on a Trump presidency would be buying shares of U.S. companies that dealt exclusively with domestic customers and suppliers . Yet the Trump trade is not much in evidence on Wall Street , where some market strategists and investors told they find it difficult to position their portfolios for his possible presidency , in part because many of his proposals are contradictory or lack specific implementation details . MORE BUSINESS COVERAGE : Ex-Goldman banker Gordon Dyal beefs up M & A boutique Amazon makes its debut in the student loan business More pain for U.S. crude Should Trump win the Nov. 8 election , some investors said , it is not clear how the New York businessman could push through policies that clash with mainstream Republican party views on free trade and low taxes . “ The investment community in particular is having trouble figuring out what ( Trump ) is about , ” said Bruce McCain , chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland . “ They are not taking individual items as seriously as they would with other candidates , ” he said . Traders said they will be watching Trump ’ s speech at the Republican convention on Thursday night for signs of how he would address business and tax issues , though they expect scant detail . The Trump campaign did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment on how investment strategists viewed his policies . U.S. stock indexes have rallied to new highs as Trump received the nomination of his party on a platform that includes a proposal to reinstate the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that would require a breakup of the largest U.S. banks . A Trump presidency “ would not be good for markets at all , ” because of the uncertainty among investors about his true priorities , said Paul Zemsky , chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York . Zemsky , however , said he has not so far been selling securities because of Trump . “ It ’ s hard to react to things that are said because of the lack of specificity , and the probability of him being elected is still low so changing your portfolio because of him is not likely to be profitable , ” he said . To be sure , Trump has supporters on Wall Street . Anthony Scaramucci , founder of SkyBridge Capital , has backed Trump and said he would be good for the economy because he would cut back on business-limiting regulations , such as those governing bank investments and labor policies . He also thinks Trump would bring in tax reform . Although never elected to public office , Trump defeated 16 Republican rivals to win the nomination . He trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points , narrowing the gap from 15 points late last week , according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday . If Trump ’ s stated proposals were carried out , that could leave the economy significantly weaker because they would result in large federal budget deficits and an anti-global stance that could hurt trade , according to a June analysis by Moody ’ s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi . Zandi forecast the loss of 3.5 million jobs during a Trump administration alongside a drop in stock prices and real estate value . Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada , build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal immigrants , and raise a 35 percent tariff on products made in Mexico by Ford and United Technologies Corp ’ s ( UTX.N ) Carrier Corp . Yet there has been no selloff of Mexican stocks , which are up 10 percent so far in 2016 . That is the best gauge of investment reaction to Trump , said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago . “ For the most part , ” Ablin said , “ that suggests to me the investment community has not considered a Trump presidency a probable scenario at this point . ”',\n",

       " 'Republicans don t seem to understand that Earth is the planet we live on.Donald Trump and his Republicans supporters in Congress are taking aim at any agency that studies climate change.Climate change has had a devastating impact on our planet . The ice sheets are melting as an unprecedented rate and sea level rise threatens to drown our coastlines , which includes Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort at Palm Beach , Florida.Furthermore , weather patterns have become more unpredictable and we are seeing more instances of major disastrous hurricanes , wildfires , droughts , etc Whether Republicans like it or not , humans have been the driving force behind climate change , and it will get even worse since Trump is giving oil , gas , coal and chemical companies the freedom to pollute more than ever before . Soon , our cities will be choked by smog and our waterways will be poisoned as global temperatures continue to rise because of all the carbon we pump into the air.That s why NASA s Earth Science Division exists to track and study climate change in order to find ways to slow it down or stop it and reverse it so that future generations of the human race can continue living on the planet . After all , we only have one planet to live on.But Republicans like Rep. Lamar Smith think NASA should make space their top priority even though Earth is far more important because without it we wouldn t be alive , and thus , unable to explore the universe.Smith wants to cut Earth Science from NASA s budget in an effort to stop the science agency from studying climate change . By rebalancing , I d like for more funds to go into space exploration ; we re not going to zero out earth sciences , Smith said . Our weather satellites have been an immense help , for example , and that s from NASA , but I d like for us to remember what our priorities are , and there are another dozen agencies that study earth science and climate change , and they can continue to do that . Meanwhile , we only have one agency that engages in space exploration , and they need every dollar they can muster for space exploration . Actually , other agencies can t continue to study climate change because Trump and his team are preventing them from doing so . That , and the fact that many of these agencies do not have the budget that NASA has to study climate change effectively pretty much means Republicans are making it their mission to gut climate change research.Before taking office , Trump demanded that the Energy Department send a list of employees and labs connected to studying climate change . And Trump s nomination of Rick Perry to head the Energy Department and anti-science Oklahoma Republican Scott Pruitt make it clear that climate change research is about to be disappeared , which is why scientists are working overtime to download all information gathered on climate change before Trump s government deletes it.Also , saving the Earth should be our top priority right now . Space can wait and NASA is already preparing to eventually send people to Mars , so it s not like NASA is incapable of doing both . But Smith wants NASA to stop studying a man-made phenomenon that will destroy us if we don t do something to stop it all because he doesn t want to anger his oil and gas industry masters.This planet is facing an impending disaster the likes of which we have never seen before . Ignoring it won t make it go away and not preparing for the effects will result in a massive loss of life and the destruction of property . And Republicans will be the ones to blame.Featured image via NASA',\n",
       " 'NRA board member , draft-dodger , pedophile , and all-around terrible person Ted Nugent has a message for those embarrassing and pathetic victims of a recent mass-stabbing at a Minnesota mall and it s one that no decent person would even consider.On September 17 , an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St . Cloud , Minnetota . He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer . Fortunately , the victims injuries were not life-threatening something most would celebrate , but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didn t bring their guns to a knife-attack.In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts , Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her . Calling the victims sad soulless & embarrassing , Nugent mocked them for being so pathetic and helpless , remarking that apparently most Americans like being victims : Previously , Nugent has attacked losers who don t carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year , blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around . Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations , but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus was not a gun-free zone and that it was common knowledge many students were armed . Disarmed and helpless is an irresponsible , suicidal choice that will get you killed , Nugent disgustingly concluded . Defend yourself . Victim-blaming is a hallmark of the Right something we can expect to see more and more of if Donald Trump is elected in November . Get out there and do something about it.Featured image via Getty Images ( Randy Snyder ) /screengrab',\n",

Americans fighting Americans over race , religion and sexual orientation . Violence and threats are being used against anyone who disagrees with the Left , while Alinsky trained activists continue to be inspired by radicals like Obama and funded by radicals like Communist George Soros . The first meeting of Portland State University s Students for Trump group was loudly interrupted and shut down by anti-Trump protesters , who barged into the group s meeting on Thursday evening.A video released by the students shows Anti-Trump protesters causing a significant disruption at the meeting , which was a closed event for members of the club.Although the conversation was initially civil , it eventually progressed into name-calling and shouting . An Anti-Trump protester threatened a student that was filming the scene : Point that f * * king camera at me Wait til that camera is not there do you want to get f * * ked up by a f * * king faggot ? After a protester took to standing on top of a table to address the crowd , a pro-Trump student suggested that starting a Students Against Trump group would have been a more productive way to combat pro-Trump students at PSU . The only way to combat this shit is to join an organization that has an anti-racist , anti-capitalist stance , another protester claimed . You need to get out of the fucking way and let people of color let these people organize themselves . Despite the meeting being a closed event for the club , the protesters demanded the right to speak . When a few pro-Trump students tried to calm down a protester yelling from atop a table , another protester yelled , If you don t let her talk , I will f * * k shit up . Although the disruption primarily led to shouting and name-calling , there were some productive discussions that happened amongst the chaos . One pro-Trump student explained that his own parents had gone through a lot to immigrate legally : My family are immigrants , they paid thousands and thousands of dollars , they waited years . I don t see why it s fair to let anyone we don t know who they are , they could be criminals , they could anything just waltz through the country with no repercussions . Although most listened respectfully as the student explained his support of Trump , one student responded that he was disappointed that a minority could support Trump : People of color Trump supporters make me so sad .

       " 'When will the libs start Delta Smelt shaming and demand answers from the left for putting a fish before the lives and livelihood of so many TV cop Tom Selleck may or may not have improperly swiped precious water by the magnum , but he didn t commit a crime , real California cops told NBC News on Wednesday.Selleck , the 70-year-old star of Blue Bloods and formerly of Magnum , P.I. , and his wife , Jillie , were sued this week by the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County for allegedly sending a water tender like the giant tanker trucks used to supply fire engines to siphon off tankloads of water from a public hydrant at a construction site at least 12 times over the last two years.The water district said in its suit that it hired a real private investigator who several times observed the same water tender leave the 61-acre ranch the fictional P.I . owns in the ritzy Hidden Valley area of Ventura County , which is in a different water district and was assessed last year at more than $ 10 million ( and was once owned by Dean Martin ) .The suit says the water district sent cease-and-desist letters to Selleck after its investigator spotted the truck at the hydrant eight times the week of Sept. 29 , 2013.But the truck showed up again in December of that year , and was tracked as it proceeded to Selleck s property , according to the suit.Then , on four straight days just last March , the same truck again drained tankloads of water from the construction site and delivered it to the Selleck ranch , the suit says . The suit seeks an order forcing Selleck to stop using the district s water , plus reimbursement for the $ 21,685.55 it paid the investigator , with damages and other costs.But the suit is a civil action , not a criminal case . Ventura County sheriff s Capt . John Riley meanwhile told NBC News that the sheriff s office did investigate allegations of criminal water theft , but we are unable to establish a crime was committed . The Ventura County district attorney s office also confirmed that no case has been referred to it for prosecution.Selleck hasn t responded to requests for comment , and it s unknown whether he has anything to do with the water truck , which is registered under a commercial license.Eric Bergh , the water district s manager of resources , said the suit wasn t meant to be an example of drought shaming , a peculiarly California activity in which people suspected of hogging water are publicly called out . Our policies have been on the books for decades , Bergh said . We just want any such activity to stop that is the bottom line for us . It s really about doing the right thing and preserving our water supply for our users . Via : CNBC',\n",
       " 'BEIJING/SHANGHAI - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $ 250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing . Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether . Watched by Trump and China ’ s President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing , U.S. planemaker Boeing Co , General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals . “ This is truly a miracle , ” China ’ s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing . The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world ’ s second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called “ shockingly high ” on Thursday . But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about , including unfettered access to the China market , cybersecurity and the growing presence of China ’ s ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms . William Zarit , chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China , said the deals pointed to “ a strong , vibrant bilateral economic relationship ” between the two countries . “ Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field , because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China. ” U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China . Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures , while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system . “ ( These deals ) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker , while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship , ” Hugo Brennan , Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft , said in a note . Some huge deals were announced . Among them is a 20-year $ 83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia , a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election . [ “ The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented , ” West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement . It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy , which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group , the country ’ s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp , one of China ’ s top five utilities . However , as is often the case during state visits , many of the deals were packaged as “ non-binding ” agreements , gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups , helping pump up the headline figure . “ I am somewhat skeptical of such a large number , ” Alex Wolf , senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments , told the Global Markets Forum , adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been “ positive ” . “ I suspect they might be primarily MOUs ( memorandum of understandings ) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less. ” Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $ 12 billion with Xiaomi , OPPO and Vivo , three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had “ longstanding relationships ” with . Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China . Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $ 37 billion at list prices , though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders . “ Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged . Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times , ” former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter . Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals , Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms , including those from the United States , and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “ Belt and Road ” infrastructure-led initiative . Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors , not China , for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get “ out of kilter ” , and repeatedly praised Xi , calling him “ a very special man ” . “ But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us , ” Trump said . Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit . Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China , executives were cautiously optimistic . “ Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing , and that ’ s great , ” said Gentry Sayad , a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing . “ Now let ’ s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward . ”',\n",
       " '- Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) CEO Tim Cook has joined a chorus of business leaders who have voiced their opposition to President Donald Trump after he blamed white nationalists and anti-racism activists equally for violence in Virginia over the weekend . “ I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis , and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights . Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans , ” Cook wrote in a note late on Wednesday to employees , according to technology news website Recode . Cook also said in the letter that Apple will donate $ 1 million a piece to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League and will match two-for-one their donations to the organizations and other human rights groups until Sept. 30 . “ Regardless of your political views , we must all stand together on this one point — that we are all equal . As a company , through our actions , our products and our voice , we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect , ” Cook wrote . Cook ’ s letter came hours after Trump disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils as several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence in Charlottesville , Virginia on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists that left a 32-year-old woman dead . “ The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me , and I ’ ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened , outraged or confused , ” Cook said . “ What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country . Hate is a cancer , and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path . Its scars last generations . History has taught us this time and time again , both in the United States and countries around the world , ” Cook added . Earlier on Wednesday , the company was disabling Apple Pay on several websites that sell attire and items in support of white nationalists and hate groups , several tech news websites reported . Apple joined social media networks Twitter Inc and LinkedIn , music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc that were cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate .',\n",

Chris Christie , who is leading Trump s transition team , said , Politics are over now . People have spoken . Time to unite the country . But the investigations into Clinton s email practices at the State Department are on track to continue regardless . According to the Washington Post , Chaffetz said it would be totally remiss of us to dismiss probes of Clinton s practices just because she fell short of winning the White House . I still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largest breaches of security at the State Department , he said . Tens of thousands of documents still have not been turned over to Congress . Chaffetz continued , A Trump administration would be cooperative in getting these floodgates to open as they should . The Utah lawmaker indicated he doesn t anticipate calling on Clinton to testify , though the committee he leads could pull other former and current State Department staffers in for more questioning.Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings , the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said it is extremely disappointing to learn that Chaffetz plans to continue investigating Clinton for years to come . After everything our country has just been through and particularly given that Donald Trump and [ House Speaker ] Paul Ryan have both called for healing our nation s divisions I think the American people deserve more from Congress than to continue squandering taxpayer dollars on these baseless Republican accusations and partisan attacks , Cummings said.Read more : Blaze',\n",
       " \"Former Clinton Labor Secretary and current Berkeley economics professor Robert Reich has long been one of Donald Trump s most vocal opponents and he thinks Trump could be done . On Thursday , he took to Twitter to outline four ways in which Trump could already be impeached and he might just be beginning , at least according to Reich.Reich , along with others , is saying that Trump s unsubstantiated claims that Obama wiretapped him are enough to impeach him.Reich also cited Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution , which forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments . Trump seems to be looking at the Office of the Presidency as just another way to increase his personal wealth . He has refused to divest himself from his businesses , even while putting his children in charge . Even before he was inaugurated , foreign diplomats began to see spending money at Trump hotels as a way to cozy up to the new American leader . Almost as soon as he took office , his Florida resort and weekend White House , Mar-A-Lago , doubled its initiation fee from $ 100,000 to a whopping $ 200,000 . But the most egregious offense was announced on Wednesday , when the Associated Press announced that China s Trademark Office gave preliminary approval to 38 new Trump trademarks.The third way Trump could be impeached today , according to Reich , is his violation of the First Amendment , which bars any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ' Trump violated this with his Muslim ban , which singles out a religion.The fourth is also a violation of the First Amendment , which also bars abridging the freedom of the press . Trump consistently labels the media as fake and even as the enemy . They are shut out of press conferences and reporters are escorted out for daring to ask tough questions.While the evidence isn t yet completely in , it s looking more and more like the ties between Trump and Russia are treason , at least according to Reich , who says : Article III Section 3 of the Constitution defines treason against the United States as adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . ' Reich argues that Trump s apparent collusion with Russians helped him win the election.By my count , there are now four grounds to impeach Trump . The fifth seems to be on its way . pic.twitter.com/PfAw0a0hfU Robert Reich ( @ RBReich ) March 9 , 2017Reich isn t delusional enough to believe that impeachment will happen under the current GOP Congress . His goal is to flip the Congress in 2018 , which means people have to stay engaged and stay aware .

It turns out that after the stock market plunge and the feeding frenzy by the leftist media , ABC News got it wrong . Flynn was actually in contact with the Russian Ambassador during the Trump transition period , which is an entirely different story . In fact , according to a video that was uncovered by citizen journalist Jack Posobiec , Obama s State Department told reporters during the Trump transition period , that the State Department didn t have any problem with the transition team meeting with any foreign officials ( See video below ) . According to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta , the Obama regime actually gave the go-ahead for Flynn to have conversations with the Russian Ambassador : On Friday , the White House said that it was the Obama administration that authorized former national security adviser Michael Flynn s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during President Trump s transition , according to CNN . Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak in the month before Trump took office , the first current or former Trump White House official brought down by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election meddling . Court records indicate that his communications with Kislyak were directed by a Trump transition official , with multiple news outlets reporting that official was Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner . They are saying here at the White House that Flynn s conversations with Sergey Kisylak were quote , authorized by the Obama administration , CNN correspondent Jim Acosta said.General Michael Flynn released the statement below : After over 33 years of military service to our country , including nearly five years in combat away from my family , and then my decision to continue to serve the United States , it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of treason and other outrageous acts .

While there , she said Moore removed her shirt and pants , then he removed his clothes . Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underwear , and put her hand on his crotch.So Vice-President Mike Pence , a right-wing Christian , has stated that he found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes , if true , this would disqualify anyone from serving in office .

       " \"It appears that several voicemail messages were obtained by the website Gawker showing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump s extremely close relationship with the supposed liberal media , despite the fact that during many of his rallies he s openly badmouthed the very media he adores covering him.According to Gawker : While Gawker was unable to independently verify their authenticity , the recordings certainly appear to be genuine . In addition to those from the MSNBC personalities , there were messages from longtime Barack Obama advisor David Axelrod , New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady , and boxing promoter Don King , all of whom spoke to Trump in a friendly and familiar manner .

Apparently wanting Trump s discount for the Gucci store that his located inside Trump s 5th Avenue building . She also apparently said : I hope you re bracing for Romney to get his butt whipped tomorrow by Obama . Showing that the message clearly dates back to the 2012 election . An election that Hall was covering . However , in yet another message , she s clearly upset with Trump over his birther nonsense : I saw the YouTube video today . I wanted to chat with you about it , since you know that I m a huge fan , and I think the world of you . But I think that thing today was not good not becoming of who I think you are as a person , as a statesman , like your award . I just thought it was just kind of crummy .

We are beginning the process to terminate Dr. Herren s faculty appointment , Mark Couch , spokesman for the school , said Thursday . She has expressed values that are at odds with ours and she has compromised her ability to meet the teaching and patient care mission of the School of Medicine . But her position at the Medical Center is likely to remain intact because her offensive comments were made outside of her workplace . They are also protected by her First Amendment rights because the hospital operates under the state , and government employees have the ability to make such comments outside of work.Dr . John Reilly Jr. , the CU vice chancellor for health affairs , wrote a letter condemning Herren s smear : Your comments and tone are harmful to the students we teach and the patients we care for . Your derogatory , insensitive remarks have resulted in harm to others in our community and beyond . For almost every day that she has been First Lady , conservatives have hurled a never-ending stream of hate and invective towards Michelle Obama . But despite the hatred , she has become one of the most popular and admired public figures in all of America . Many have signed petitions asking her to run for public office such as the Senate or even the White House , but she has said she wants to return to private life when President Obama leaves office.Featured image via YouTube',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - Haitian immigrants on Tuesday decried a U.S. decision to end a program that granted 59,000 Haitians temporary visas after the 2010 earthquake , saying they would be sent back to a country that has yet to recover from that disaster and others since . The United States offered Temporary Protected Status , or TPS , to Haitians after the January 2010 earthquake killed some 300,000 people and devastated a country that has long been the poorest in the Americas . The administration of former President Barack Obama extended the program several times , finding that conditions in Haiti were too dire to send the beneficiaries home . President Donald Trump ’ s administration , after previously granting a six-month extension , announced on Monday that it would end TPS for Haiti in July 2019 . Any Haitian who can not obtain another kind of U.S. visa will be subject to deportation back to the Caribbean nation , where some earthquake victims are still homeless and the country is wobbling from Hurricane Matthew , a cholera outbreak and political instability . “ We ’ re just left in a void , ” said Sebastian Joseph , 26 , a Haitian immigrant living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn where Haitians and other Caribbeans are concentrated . He said virtually all Haitians want to stay in the United States , where they have carved out a niche in construction and healthcare services such as caring for the elderly and sick . “ America has been the home of the free for 200 years or more . Everybody wants to come to America , ” Joseph said . “ A lot of people will go back to nothing. ” Trump ’ s supporters note that the visa program was always meant to be temporary and that Trump ran a 2016 presidential campaign promising restrictive immigration policies . At least one Haitian TPS recipient in Brooklyn accepted that eventually she must return . “ If they say I have 18 months and that ’ s it , I say thank God , and then I will go , ” said Margaret Etienne , who gave birth to a 3-year-old son here who is now a U.S. citizen . “ It ’ s my country . I love my country , ” she said after buying takeout from a Haitian restaurant with her son on a stretch of Church Avenue that is also called Bob Marley Boulevard , after the late Jamaican musician . In ending the TPS designation , acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said she had determined that the “ extraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist. ” Some critics dispute that Haiti has recovered and question how Duke reached such a conclusion . Senator Marco Rubio , a Republican from Florida , the state with the most Haitians , urged Trump to extend TPS , warning in a column he wrote for the Miami Herald that “ Haitians sent home will face dire conditions , including lack of housing , inadequate health services and low prospects for employment. ” Fifty-nine percent of Haiti ’ s population lives below the poverty line of $ 2.41 per day , according to the World Bank . “ It ’ s not going to be good for me . I don ’ t know what I would do , ” said Ives Joseph Laforgue , 63 , an unemployed Haitian immigrant in Flatbush who said he had open-heart surgery in 2014 and lives off the charity of Brooklyn ’ s Haitian community . Still , he said he would have even less in Haiti . Haitian community leaders and pro-immigration politicians in New York on Tuesday pledged to pressure the Trump administration to extend TPS . Among them was U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez , a Democrat who introduced legislation that would protect from deportation immigrants who have TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure ( DED ) , another program subject to presidential discretion that was extended by Obama but is due to expire in March 2018 . Ricot Dupuy , station manager of Radio Soleil , a Haitian-themed broadcaster in New York , said he thinks the decision is racially motivated . “ This pressure to send immigrants back home ... The idea is to whiten America , ” Dupuy said from his Brooklyn studio . “ The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not stupid . They know that TPS holders , it ’ s good for this country . The business community knows it ’ s good for them . And eventually they may have the last word . ”',\n",

Phares did not speak to reporters as he entered the committee ’ s classified meeting room around 11 am EDT ( 1600 GMT ) or when he left about four hours later . In response to a request for comment Phares ’ assistant told Reuters : “ Dr . Phares is not making any comments for now. ” The House Intelligence panel does not discuss details of most of the dozens of interviews conducted behind closed doors during its months-long investigation , but it has been disclosed publicly that Phares has come under congressional scrutiny over his connections with Russia . Senator Dianne Feinstein , the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , wrote last month to Phares , who was a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser , asking him to turn over “ documents related to Russian contacts and the Republican Party ’ s position on Ukraine. ” In her letter to Phares , Feinstein said she was interested in a meeting that he and two other Trump advisers allegedly held during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 with Sergei Kislyak , then Russia ’ s ambassador to the United States . On Nov. 29 , when Feinstein announced her request , a Phares aide said he maintains Kislyak was just one of many foreign diplomats present at a panel discussion , which could not “ fairly ” be described as a meeting with Russian officials . The Senate Judiciary and Senate Intelligence panels are also investigating Russia and last year ’ s election and possible collusion between Trump associates and Moscow , as is Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller . U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win the White House . Russia denies any such effort and Trump has dismissed talk of collusion .',\n",
       " 'On January 13 , 2016 , Michigan governor Rick Snyder held a press conference to announce the discovery of an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city of Flint.According to officials in the Snyder administration , there have been 87 confirmed cases of the disease . Ten people have died as a result.Legionnaire s disease is caused by a deadly waterborne bacteria , called Legionella.Unlike lead poisoning , the other major water-related health crisis now facing the people of Flint , Legionnaire s disease is not caused by drinking contaminated water . Instead , the bacteria enters the body through the lungs , via water droplets in the air.On Wednesday Snyder officials claimed that they can neither confirm or deny that the outbreak is linked to the city s contaminated water supply.As The Atlantic reports here , the outbreak began shortly after the Snyder administration switched the city of Flint s water supply to the Flint River.According to the US Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease occurs when two or more people are infected with the bacteria.In Flint , almost ninety people are known to have been infected by the disease between June 2014 and November 2015.What s infuriating about the Legionnaire s outbreak in Flint is that officials in the Snyder administration certainly knew about it long before Wednesday s press conference . Yet they said nothing until now.As reported here , between June 2014 to March 2015 , the number of confirmed cases of Legionnaire s Disease in Flint skyrocketed.During the previous five years the city saw a fairly steady number of cases of the disease , which averaged about eight to ten cases during a ten month reporting period.But by March of 2015 , the number of confirmed cases had spiked to 4x the prior average . Between June 2014 and March 2015 , there were 45 confirmed cases of the disease . Seven people died from Legionnaire s Disease during that ten month period.Yet after seeing this sudden increase , officials in the Snyder administration took no action . There was no effort made to identify a possible source , although the Center for Disease Control provides specific guidelines for doing so . The public was also not notified that there was an outbreak , although the state health department knew , or should have known , at least by March of last year , if not sooner.Between March of 2015 and November of 2015 , another 42 cases of Legionnaire s Disease were confirmed in Flint . Three more people died after being exposed to the waterborne bacteria.Still there was no mention of an outbreak until January 13 , 2016.Snyder s press conference on Wednesday was the first time any official made mention of a Legionnaire s outbreak in the city , although at least ten deaths have been caused by the disease.State officials virtually ignored this deadly outbreak for almost a year . Then all of the sudden , on Wednesday , Governor Snyder called a press conference to inform the public that there is an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city.The question of how state officials could have just now discovered something that has been going on for this long may not be difficult to answer.Last week the federal government announced a Justice Department probe into the Flint water crisis . The announcement followed an investigation by the ACLU , which revealed that state officials had falsified documents and rigged tests to cover up the fact that the city s water is contaminated with lead.Over 200 children are confirmed to have lead poisoning because of the actions of Snyder and his appointed representatives . An additional 9,000 children are likely to be impacted . The number of adults who are affected is currently unknown , but likely stretches into the thousands.A Justice Department investigation into the Flint water crisis would undoubtedly reveal that the Snyder administration concealed information on the Legionnaire s outbreak from the public.What else has Rick Snyder s administration been hiding and lying about ? We may never know.Just as the Snyder administration was coming under intense scrutiny over the city s toxic water , someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall . As Addicting Info reported here , the break-in conveniently targeted the vacant office where Flint s water records are stored.According to the CDC , a state health agency is responsible to conduct an investigation into the source of an Legionnaire s outbreak . Such an investigation is advised by the CDC any time there is an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease or an increase in the severity of cases ( such as when the disease causes hospitalizations and deaths . ) Outbreaks of Legionnaire s disease , such the one happening in Flint , would require an immediate investigation to determine the source as well as an urgent response from the state health department.Because of the timing and severity of the outbreak , which directly coincided with the switch of the water source , public health officials should have started an investigation into the source of the bacteria months ago . Instead they did nothing.State officials say they haven t made a direct connection between the city s contaminated water and the outbreak of the disease . That s more than likely because they never tried to identify the source of the outbreak . They just ignored it.Watch this video , recorded by club937 in January of last year , which shows the quality of the city s water . We know that the water in Flint is contaminated with lead , a substance that causes a wide range of physical and mental disabilities , especially in children . We also know that the citizens of Flint were repeatedly told by the governor and members of his administration that the water was perfectly safe to drink.What s most frightening about the possibility that the city s water is the cause of the outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease is that people do not have to drink it to be exposed to the bacteria . This bacteria is associated with inhaling water particles , meaning that people can become deathly sick from simply bathing , showering , washing their hands or performing other tasks that most of us take for granted.Handing out bottled drinking water and lead filters isn t going to cut it.I can not think of a single reason why the people of Flint would trust anything that Governor Snyder or members of his administration tell them about the water . They have been told lie after lie by this administration , ever since the city s water source was switched to the Flint River.What we can already say about the Legionnaire s outbreak is that state officials were aware of it months ago , yet they took no steps to protect public health . Ten people are dead.Snyder says he s not sure if the city s water is responsible for those deaths . That acknowledgment alone is enough to cause public outrage . It is his job to know . It was his job to know back in March , when there were already seven deaths attributed to this disease . But he didn t give a shit back in March . You know why ? Because the federal government was not investigating Flint s water crisis back in March.Snyder and every member of his administration has got to go . Every shred of trust the public may have had in this administration is gone . It will never be back . No amount of PR from the governor s office is ever going to repair this.These are life and death issues for Flint residents . They need answers that they can trust , and they deserve to have representation that they can trust as they try to navigate their way through this incalculable nightmare.It was bad when they couldn t drink the water . Now there s a new threat looming over their heads , and that threat comes from the possibility that any contact with the water whatsoever could cause them to become deathly ill.These citizens can not be expected to look to the same people who caused this disaster for answers now . They can not be asked to trust the same administration that has lied to them over and over in the past , to tell them the truth now.Snyder and his administration are now saying they aren t sure if the city s water killed ten people . They don t exactly know if the water is safe to shower in , bathe in , wash your hands in . That s what they re saying now , when last week they said they were sure the water was safe for all of those things.At least a dozen petitions to recall Governor Rick Snyder have been filed in recent days . The Michigan Board of State Canvassers continues to throw the recall Snyder petitions out.Oddly enough the right wing majority board had no problem approving two Tea-Party backed recall petitions targeting state legislatures who voted in favor of a tax increase to help repair the state s dangerously neglected roads.To the citizens of Michigan I would ask , how many people have to get sick , and how many children have to be poisoned , and how many deaths have to be counted , before partisan political bullshit takes a backseat to the health and safety of your fellow citizens ? You need to get this man , and every member of his blatantly corrupt administration out of office . * Featured image credit : Video screen capture club937.com',\n",
       " '69 people were shot in gun-free Chicago over this past Memorial Day weekend . Meanwhile Barack Obama is busy working with Black Lives Matter terror groups to point fingers at law enforcement and white people for the crisis majority black neighborhoods are facing in their communities . When will the media start exposing the truth about gun-free zones in America ? It should be clear to every American that violent gun related crimes don t stop because you put up a gun-free zone sign in a neighborhood filled with bad guys.Instead of focusing on broken families , elected Democrats have been ignoring these communities for decades in favor of kickbacks and favors from vendors and contractors and in many cases , outright theft from money that was designated for local schools or community improvement projects . Unless and until someone gets serious about finding jobs for blacks and cutting off welfare funding as a reward for teenage and single moms to have multiple children , this problem will only get worse . Children need a father in the home period.Here are a few crime statistics that prove most of the crime victims in the gun-free city of Chicago are black males . Black on black crimes are the biggest issue these communities face , yet Obama and race baiters for hire across America have magically turned the argument around and are blaming Whites and cops for the huge uptick in violence in these mostly black neighborhoods.Sadly , a large number of the crimes have gone unsolved , as people who live in these neighborhoods don t want to rat out the killers . ( Note the number of shootings where police were involved vs. the number of shootings between citizens HELLO Black Lives Matter ! ) Here s what black Chicago residents really think of their Democrat leaders , including the former Chicago community organizer/hustler , Barack Hussein Obama . They explain how Democrats are really the people responsible for perpetuating black on black crime : BLOODY MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND : Just after midnight , in one of the last shootings of the Memorial Day weekend , two people pulled out guns and started firing in East Garfield Park.The first call to police early Tuesday was for one person shot on Homan Avenue . Then a second victim . Then a third . Then someone walked into a hospital a few minutes later.In all , 27 of the 69 people hit by gunfire over the weekend were shot in or near the Harrison District , one of the city s most violent and one of the most heavily patrolled by police.So many people were shot there that Deputy Superintendent John Escalante promised Sunday to beef up patrols . Nine more people were shot there by early Tuesday.The breakdown from the weekend is : Three people killed and 12 people wounded Friday afternoon through early Saturday ; one person killed and 24 people wounded Saturday evening through early Sunday ; 13 people wounded Sunday afternoon through early Monday ; and 16 people shot Monday into early Tuesday , two of them fatally.Here s a SHOCKING 30 DAY Stupidity Trend from HeyJackass.comThe holiday weekend was police Superintendent Eddie Johnson s first since Mayor Rahm Emanuel picked the veteran cop to lead the embattled department in late March . The department sought volunteers to work overtime over the weekend , although police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi did not release figures on how many officers worked . Instead of hiring more cops during a city budget crunch , Emanuel instead has relied heavily on overtime to try to tamp down violence . Via : Chicago TribuneWith the constant bashing of law enforcement by Black Lives Matter terrorists , coupled with the desire by Barack Obama and AG Loretta Lynch to tie the hands of cops across America , it should come as no surprise that cops are no longer willing to go the extra mile to protect those who would like to see them harmed.Question : How much on average does it cost for each gunshot victim in Chicago in 2016 ? Answer : An ASTOUNDING $ 68,683 * per person * Costs assume the following : $ 55,000 : Average gunshot victim ER and hospital expenses . $ 1000 : Average CFD ambulance ride , only applicable to 80 % of victims , rest self-transport . $ 800 : Homicide-related autopsies . Doesn t include hospice care or ongoing rehabilitation . Cost estimates provided by Chicago Killings Cost $ 2.5 Billion .',\n",

       " 'BEIJING - A top Chinese coal miner , Yankuang Group , and U.S. industrial gas supplier Air Products and Chemicals Inc on Thursday said they planned to build a $ 3.5 billion coal-to-synthesis gas ( syngas ) plant in China . The announcement on the facility in the province of Shaanxi comes as part of U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s state visit to China , the world ’ s biggest consumer of coal . The deal is yet to be finalised , although the companies said in a statement that they would look to do this as soon as possible . Syngas is a combination of hydrogen , carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide that is typically manufactured by gasifying a solid hydrocarbon fuel . It can be used to create energy or to help churn out products such as methane or methanol . Under the agreement , Air Products and Shaanxi Future Energy Group Co ( SFEC ) , a subsidiary of Yankuang , will form a joint venture , in which Air Products will have a majority stake . It will build , own and operate an air separation , gasification and syngas clean-up system in the city of Yulin to supply SFEC , the firms said in a statement . The air separation units are expected to produce about 40,000 tonnes per day ( TPD ) of oxygen to support the production of about 2.5 million normal cubic meters an hour of syngas . SFEC will supply coal , steam and power and receive syngas under a long-term , onsite contract . Air Products currently supplies SFEC ’ s Phase 1 project in Yulin with 12,000 TPD of oxygen . The addition of Phase 2 would make the complex one of the largest coal-to-fuel and chemicals facilities in China , with SFEC Phase 2 producing 4 million tonnes per year of liquid fuels and downstream chemicals , it said . The companies expect the overall project to come onstream in 2021 .',\n",
       " 'President Obama is clearly not letting GOP threats of obstruction interfere with his duty to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice.The president began interviewing Supreme Court candidates on Tuesday , paying little attention to republican foot-stomping and temper tantrums.Following the unexpected death of Antonin Scalia in February , President Obama made it abundantly clear that he intends to fulfill his duty under the U.S. Constitution by appointing a justice to fill the vacant seat.Although republicans have promised to block any potential nominee the president puts forward , President Obama is moving ahead and doing the job he was elected to do.According to NPR , the president has already interviewed several candidates , one of whom is likely to be chosen to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.NPR reports that the top three candidates include Judges Merrick Garland and Sri Srinivasan , both of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia , and Judge Paul Watford , of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.Judge Garland was first appointed to the DC court by Bill Clinton . President Obama considered him as a replacement for former Supreme Court Justice Stevens upon his retirement , but ultimately named Justice Elena Kagan to fill Stevens seat.Garland was part of the three-judge panel which ruled against the U.S. government s right to hold 17 Uighurs , a Muslim minority group from China , at Guant namo . The ruling dealt a huge blow to the Bush administration s secretive tribunals . Liberal backlash over Judge Srinivasan s appointment to the DC court in 2010 was centered on his role in the the defense of Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling.Since that time , however , Srinivasan has played a major role in overturning the Defense of Marriage Act . He has also written the majority opinion in important cases like Sierra Club v. Jewell , which upheld the standing of environmental groups fighting to protect a historical site in West Virginia , Pom Wonderful v. FTC , which upheld the right of the FTC to require health-related advertising to be truthful , and Home Care Association of America v. Weil , which extended labor protections to home health workers.Judge Watford was appointed to the 9th Circuit Court by President Obama in 2011.He authored the majority opinion in Patel & Patel v. City of Los Angeles , which struck down a local ordinance requiring hotel owners to turn guest registry information over to the police without a warrant.Other potential candidates that the president is considering include Judge Jane Kelly of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis ; and U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson , who serves in Washington , D.C.Although republicans have threatened to block any nominee that the president proposes , republican obstructionism has been ongoing since the day he took office . Yet somehow , President Obama has managed to accomplish more than any president in modern history.President Obama says he is going to do his job and appoint the next Supreme Court justice.If there s anything republicans should have learned by now , it s that the president does exactly what he says he is going to do.Featured image via wikimedia commons',\n",

       " 'Hillary Clinton s camp took aim at Donald Trump and his recent efforts to lure black voters into backing him , slamming his minority outreach efforts as shameful , insulting and cowardly . Marlon Marshall , Hillary for America s Director of State campaigns and Political Engagement , released a statement on Thursday in response to the latest update on Trump s upcoming visit to an African-American church in Detroit . Not only will Trump not be speaking to the congregation , but the one-on-one interview he will be having with the pastor after the service will be carefully scripted . Donald Trump s latest gimmick to act as if he cares about the black community is downright shameful , insulting and cowardly , Marshall wrote . After 14 months of neglecting us , Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community . Not surprisingly , Trump s ignorance on issues like the economy , criminal justice reform , the meaning of quality health care or systemic racism , has forced him to resort to scripted conversations and staged engagements with our communities . According to the leaked script , the questions that will be asked by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson will be written in advance and the GOP nominee s answers will be carefully prepared ahead of time as well . Marshall slammed Trump for this bogus attempt at scripted outreach to the black community . The problem is , our community can see through this : outreach to African Americans can not be scripted ; leaders ought to be prepared to address the hard truths about race and justice in our country , Marshall wrote . And Trump s discomfort on addressing these issues only reinforces that he s unfit to be our president . Trump s so-called minority outreach has not been going over as well as he hoped . What was his master plan to woo black voters and make them forget that he is endorsed by the KKK ?

       " 'Our country is spinning out of control . Obama s orchestrated efforts with race baiters like Al Sharpton and leaders of Black Lives Matter terrorists have created a divide between races like my generation has never known . Obama skips Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia s funeral and the funeral of iconic First Lady , Nancy Reagan , but finds time to take a few pot shots at GOP presidential front-runner , Donald Trump while attending a hipster festival with Michelle . Barack s proven over and over he doesn t have the time or desire to behave like a leader , and now , he s going to tell the Europeans what they need to do as it relates to the EU ? When I heard from the Baron today that our current president is planning to go to Britain to make a case to the public for staying in the European Union , I was momentarily stunned . What happened to leading from behind and letting other countries handle their own affairs ? By now we re all jaded by this president . He does nothing for free , nothing in which there is not some eventual pay-off to him . So sticking his nose into Britain s affairs should come as no surprise , given his track record of the last interminable years of his time in office.Or maybe he doesn t know how deeply disliked he is by anyone who didn t sign onto his pathetic Peace Prize back in the beginning of his reign ? Maybe he believes what the sycophantic press tells him ? Or or wait ! Is he using a kind of reverse psychology on the British i.e. , knowing how much he is held in contempt , anything he suggests , they would oppose ? Nah he s far too removed from reality to grasp that concept.So here we have London Mayor Boris Johnson s take on the subject . He s far more interesting to follow on this than any national government figures would be . Via : Gates Of ViennaThese excerpts are from The Telegraph . The only thing Mr J got wrong is the extent to which Obama has undermined America s sovereignty , particularly at our southern border and on the subject of changing our culture and monolingual character . One could say that Mr. Obama s decision to drop in and lecture the Brits on this particular subject is not contradictory at all ; it is congruent with his own behavior and sentiments regarding America s sovereignty.Obviously , Mr. Johnson hasn t been paying attention to the American presidential campaign . But they why would he ? Had he done so , though , he d have seen an unprecedented populist following for Donald Trump , based on that theme : sovereignty.We want ours back in one piece.I love America . I believe in the American dream . Indeed , I hold that the story of the past 100 years has been very largely about how America rose to global greatness and how America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around the world . In two global conflicts , and throughout the Cold War , the United States has fought for the founding ideals of the republic : that government of the people , by the people , for the people should not perish from the earth.So it is on the face of it a bit peculiar that U.S. government officials should believe that Britain must remain within the EU a system in which democracy is increasingly undermined.Some time in the next couple of months we are told that President Obama himself is going to arrive in this country , like some deus ex machina , to pronounce on the matter . Air Force One will touch down ; a lectern with the presidential seal will be erected . The British people will be told to be good to themselves , to do the right thing . We will be informed by our most important ally that it is in our interests to stay in the EU , no matter how flawed we may feel that organisation to be . Never mind the loss of sovereignty ; never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the uncontrolled immigration.The American view is very clear . Whether in code or en clair , the President will tell us all that UK membership of the EU is right for Britain , right for Europe , and right for America . And why ? Because that or so we will be told is the only way we can have influence in the counsels of the nations.It is an important argument , and deserves to be taken seriously . I also think it is wholly fallacious and coming from Uncle Sam , it is a piece of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America . This is a nation born from its glorious refusal to accept overseas control . Almost two and a half centuries ago the American colonists rose up and violently asserted the principle that they and they alone should determine the government of America , and not George III or his ministers . To this day the Americans refuse to kneel to almost any kind of international jurisdiction . Alone of Western nations , the US declines to accept that its citizens can be subject to the rulings of the International Criminal Court in The Hague . They have not even signed up to the Convention on the Law of the Sea . Can you imagine the Americans submitting their democracy to the kind of regime that we have in the EU ? So why is it essential for Britain to comply with a system that the Americans would themselves reject out of hand ? Is it not a blatant case of Do as I say , but not as I do ?

       " 'Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer wrote a column discussing Donald Trump s mental health on Thursday and he did not hold back.Krauthammer , who happens to be a board-certified psychiatrist , strongly rebuked the Republican nominee for viciously attacking Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala , who lost their son Humayun when he sacrificed his life to save his fellow American soldiers in Iraq . It reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency and of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows parental grief , Krauthammer wrote . It wasn t a mistake . It was a revelation . Krauthammer then put his psychiatry skills to work , slamming Trump s narcissism and thin skin . Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited , untempered Pavlovian responses are , shall we say , unusual in both ferocity and predictability.This is beyond narcissism . I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old , an undeveloped schoolyard bully . I was off by about 10 years . His needs are more primitive , an infantile hunger for approval and praise , a craving that can never be satisfied . He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value indeed exists only insofar as it sustains and inflates him . Krauthammer went on to say that Trump is struggling to pass the threshold test for acceptability , comparing this year s election to the 1980 Election in which Reagan defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter . Trump badly needs to pass that threshold , he wrote . If character is destiny , he won t. Indeed , Trump is definitely no Ronald Reagan . Reagan spoke positively about America and the future while Trump is all gloom and doom and doesn t know when to keep his mouth shut.Krauthammer is not the only mental health professional who has talked about Trump s mental health status either.Dr . Drew Pinsky appeared on CNN earlier this week and expressed concern about Trump s temperament and impulsiveness . The question , though , is , are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected ? That s a pretty hard thing to predict . I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics , or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses ? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech , I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions . Pinsky went on to question the mental stability of Trump s supporters.Clearly , there is something wrong with Donald Trump and he is not fit to be president of the United States at a time when there is so much conflict and upheaval in the world . We need a steady hand at the helm , not a hand that lashes out over every little slight and criticism , especially when that hand belongs to a man who is obsessed with using nuclear weapons . Mental instability and access to the nuclear codes would be a dangerous combination.Featured Image : John Moore/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'This very important scandal is unfolding before us . It has many , many legs with different Obama administration officials involved . Don t count on the main stream media to fill you in . This is a big deal ! Andrew McCarthy said it best : The national-security adviser is not an investigator . She is a White House staffer . The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence , not a generator or collector of it . If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans , it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests ; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests . Circa News has been uncovering disturbing information regarding the unmasking of American citizens and how Obama provided a way for the unmasking to go unfettered . Susan Rice and Samantha Power both have unfettered access to classified material and likely unmasked many in government . Sara Carter reports below on H.R . McMaster s involvement in this unmasking : Almost one month after it was disclosed that former President Obama s National Security Adviser Susan Rice was unmasking members of President Trump s team and other Americans , Trump s own national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her need-to-know requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure , Circa has confirmed.The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice s home during the last week of April . Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster s decision , according to two Senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official , who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named . This is the letter from McMaster to Rice . Names , phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred . I hereby waive the requirement that you must have a need-to-know to access any classified information contained in items you originated , reviewed , signed or received while serving , as National Security Adviser , the letter said . The letter also states that the NSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information . Circa revealed in March that during President Obama s tenure , top aides including Rice , former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad . They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism , espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats , according to documents obtained by Circa.In June , the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Rice as part of the committee s larger investigation into the unmasking of Americans under the Obama administration . Rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committee.Under the law , and under certain conditions , it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information , and their need to know is waived under Executive Order 13526 Section 4.4 Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government Personnel . But the White House officials told Circa that under the current congressional investigation , and given President Trump s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked , Rice s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation . Rice and Brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of Americans in NSA-sourced intelligence reports , but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper . Former U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also has legal authority to unmask officials.In a June tweet , Trump called the revelation that Rice and other Obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the big story the unmasking and surveillance that took place during the Obama administration . Basically , this letter which was signed in the last week of April undercuts the president s assertion that Susan Rice s unmasking activity was inappropriate . In essence , anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information , said a senior West Wing official , who was shown the document by Circa and verified its authenticity . In fact , they would have their security clearance and right to need-to-know stripped . The point is , is that it lowers the bar for her , the Senior West Wing official said . This memo McMaster sent to Rice makes it so that she doesn t have to prove a continuing need-to-know to have access to classified information and in effect is a White House pardon of Susan Rice and could be used by other Obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense , the official added.REMEMBER THAT RICE RECENTLY LIED AGAIN ABOUT THE UNMASKING SHE DID IT ON NATIONAL TV : If the Obama administration was good at anything , it was good at lying to hijack the narrative.Remember when Susan Rice lied after Benghazi ? It is what she does so well . Flash forward to the latest hot water she s in and it s hard to tell what she d want us believe this time WHICH SHOULD WE BELIEVE ? WHAT SHE SAID TO ANDREA MITCHELL OR TO JUDY WOODRUFF ? Susan Rice appeared on Andrea Mitchell . She claimed she didn t leak nothing to nobody Did you catch that double negative ? There might be more to that because she s using words in the two sentences very carefully .Check it out : SUSAN RICE VERSION ONE : WATCH : Susan Rice insists I leaked nothing to nobody https : //t.co/kAsbu4VJDN MSNBC ( @ MSNBC ) April 4 , 2017SUSAN RICE VERSION TWO : I know nothing about this . I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today . What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this ? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi . Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now . She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it . Yes , red flags are everywhere on this ! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him : The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble !

       " 'BEIJING - China must step up vigilance against plots to grab power , as political corruption is the worst form of corruption , Wang Qishan , the country s still influential former top graft-buster , wrote on Tuesday . Wang , a key ally of President Xi Jinping , stepped down in a leadership reshuffle last month at the end of the five-yearly Communist Party Congress , but could assume a new role , say sources with ties to the leadership , though an announcement might not come for a few more weeks . As the feared head of the party s anti-corruption watchdog for the past five years , Wang has spearheaded Xi s battle on graft , overseeing the jailing of dozens of former top officials , including the domestic security chief , Zhou Yongkang . China has rebuffed criticism that the corruption campaign is as much about settling political scores as about stamping out genuine criminal acts . Writing in the party s official People s Daily , Wang said the fight against corruption went beyond battling the pilfering of assets or hedonism and was a political battle . Political corruption is the biggest corruption , Wang wrote in comments drawn from a collection of essays released after the congress , but not previously published in full by state media . The collection included pieces by former members of the Politburo Standing Committee , the height of power in China . Aspects of political corruption include the formation of special interest groups to try and seize power , and the organization of activities outside party parameters , aimed at breaking party unity , Wang wrote . There are many new historical special characteristics to carrying on this great fight , the most important of which are to ... prevent them from seizing political power and changing the party s basic character , he added . Wang explicitly linked some of the most notorious cases to political crimes , mentioning not only Zhou but also the former party bosses of the southwestern city of Chongqing , Bo Xilai and Sun Zhengcai , two former top generals and a former top aide to retired president Hu Jintao . In these cases , the party had eradicated interest groups which mixed political and economic corruption , Wang wrote . Bo was jailed for life in 2013 , while Sun was put under investigation for corruption in July . There can be no challenges to the party s power , Wang added . North , south , east , west and at the center , the party leads everything . If there is no forceful and strong leadership by the party , then the Chinese people are simply a loose plate of sand .',\n",
       " 'If you ve ever wondered why the United States gives Israel billions of dollars a year in so-called assistance , you need not wonder anymore . It s all about working the system , and pro-Israel lobbyists and billionaires like casino mogul Sheldon Edelson know exactly what they are doing to exploit the American process : They buy American politicians.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is about to receive a big present from Sheldon Adelson of $ 100 million for his campaign . However , there is an exchange here : If Trump becomes president , then he must ensure that the U.S. continue its unwavering financial support for Israel despite the fact that we can t afford clean water in Flint and our national infrastructure is failing . The U.S. also sends billions to Israel despite the fact that Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians since 1947 and treats them in a way that civil rights activist Desmond Tutu described as worse than the apartheid regime that existed in South Africa.How much money does the U.S. give to Israel ? The state of Israel currently receives a staggering $ 3 billion a year in so-called aid , much of it for its military , which is then used to brutalize the Palestinian people in the form of a military occupation and a settlement apparatus of land theft that is illegal under international law . With the current agreement set to expire in 2017 , Israel wants a raise . They are now asking for an estimated $ 5 billion a year over the next ten years , for a total of more than $ 50 billion . In fact , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrogantly rejected President Obama s recent offer , which is about $ 40 billion over ten years . Israel has said that it may hold out for the next president in order to get a better deal.According to Sheldon Adelson , that next president may be Donald Trump . The $ 100 million he will give to Trump may seem substantial but Adelson , whose loyalties are with Israel , is willing to spend $ 100 million in order to receive billions for the apartheid state in return . Here s what Donald Trump tweeted about Adelson s previous support for former candidate Marco Rubio : Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet . I agree ! Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 13 , 2015Since the campaign money is now coming Trump s way , you can bet that Trump is ready to be Israel s puppet and give it what it wants . In an attempt to court big pro-Israel donors , Trump has already stated that he supports the continuation of illegal settlement construction in the Palestinian West Bank . The billions of dollars that will help Israel continue to rob and oppress the Palestinians will come from fleecing the U.S. taxpayer of money that instead can go to our schools and our healthcare system.Donald Trump is just another political phony who is willing to sell his own country down the river to the highest foreign bidder for personal power.Watch video here : [ youtube https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=b1eNaH-D_5I ] Featured image via video screenshot .',\n",

       " 'Special Report : Savvy neocons see Hillary Clinton as their Trojan Horse to be pulled into the White House by Democratic voters , raising the question : would a Clinton-45 presidency mean more wars , asks Robert Parry Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe Democratic Party establishment seems determined to drag Hillary Clinton s listless campaign across the finish line of her race with Bernie Sanders and then count on Republican divisions to give her a path to the White House . But if she gets there the world should hold its breath.If Clinton becomes President , she will be surrounded by a neocon-dominated American foreign policy establishment that will press her to resume its regime change strategies in the Middle East and escalate its new and dangerous Cold War against Russia.If Bashar al-Assad is still president of Syria , there will be demands that she finally go for the knock-out blow ; there will be pressure , too , for her to ratchet up sanctions on Iran pushing Tehran toward renouncing the nuclear agreement ; there are already calls for deploying more U.S. troops on Russia s border and integrating Ukraine into the NATO military structure.President Clinton-45 would hear the clever talking points justifying these moves , the swaggering tough-guy/gal rhetoric , and the tear-jerking propaganda about evil enemies throwing babies off incubators , giving Viagra to soldiers to rape more women , and committing horrific crimes ( some real but many imagined ) against defenseless innocents.Does anyone think that Hillary Clinton has the wisdom to resist these siren songs of confrontation and war , even if she were inclined to ? President Barack Obama , who for all his faults has a much deeper and subtler intellect than Hillary Clinton , found himself so battered by these pressures from the militaristic Washington playbook that he whined about his predicament to The Atlantic s Jeffrey Goldberg , himself a neocon war hawk.The Washington foreign policy establishment is now so profoundly in the hands of the neocons and their liberal interventionist sidekicks that the sitting President presumably couldn t find anyone but a neocon to give those interviews to , even as he complained about how the U.S. capital is in the hands of warmongers.Given this neocon domination of U.S. foreign policy especially in the State Department bureaucracy , the major media and the big think tanks Clinton will be buffeted by hawkish demands and plans both from outside of her administration and from within . ARCHTECTS OF WAR : Neocon war hawk and Israeli advocate Robert Kagan and his wife Victoria Nuland are hoping for a Clinton win n November.Already key neocons , such as the Brookings Institution s Robert Kagan , are signaling that they expect to have substantial influence over Clinton s foreign policy . Kagan , who has repackaged himself as a liberal interventionist , threw his support to Clinton , who put him on a State Department advisory board.There is also talk in Washington that Kagan s neocon wife , Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland , another Clinton favorite and the architect of the regime change in Ukraine , would be in line for a top foreign policy job in a Clinton-45 administration.Neocons Back in ChargeSo , Clinton s election could mean that some of the most dangerous people in American foreign policy would be whispering their schemes for war and more war directly into her ear and her record shows that she is very susceptible to such guidance.At every turn , as a U.S. senator and as Secretary of State , Clinton has opted for regime change solutions from the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the Honduras coup in 2009 to the Libyan air war in 2011 to the Syria civil war since 2011 or she has advocated for the escalation of conflicts , such as in Afghanistan and with Iran , rather than engaging in reasonable give-and-take negotiations.Though her backers tout her experience as Secretary of State , the reality was that she repeatedly disdained genuine diplomacy and was constantly hectoring President Obama into adopting the most violent and confrontational options.He sometimes did ( the Afghan surge , the Libyan war , the Iran nuclear stand-off ) but he sometimes didn t ( reversing the Afghan escalation , finally negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran after Clinton left , rejecting a direct U.S. military assault on the Syrian government , and working at times with the Russians on Iran and Syria ) .In other words , Obama acted as a register or brake restraining Clinton s hawkishness . With Clinton as the President , however , she would have no such restraints . One could expect her to endorse many if not all the harebrained neocon schemes , much as President George W. Bush did when his neocon advisers exploited his fear and fury over 9/11 to guide him into their regime change agenda for the Middle East . After Bush s Iraq invasion in 2003 , Washington s neocons were joking about whether Iran or Syria should come next , with the punch line : Real men go to Tehran ! But the Iraq War wasn t the cakewalk that the neocons had predicted .

Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way , Chris , let s back up . So you re saying you used the word squishy which , itself , is unusual to describe the president s state of mind . So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin ? Why are they still in there ? Cuomo responded , It s not about CNN . It s about what the president said , Kellyanne . Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him , Aren t you the least bit reluctant , if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America ?

       " 'ZURICH - Investigators in Zurich , ranked among the world s cleanest cities , are probing alleged grubby dealings within the municipal garbage and recycling department . While trash services in the United States and Italy have sometimes been linked with illicit dealings , the Swiss financial center appears an unlikely source of muck . Rubbish bins are ubiquitous , and a fleet of motorized street sweepers keeps boulevards nearly spotless . But so far Zurich has unearthed irregular accounting surrounding some $ 15 million in cost overruns on one of its marquee projects , possible nepotism and an alleged off-the-books slush fund , according to a series of reports released last week . The garbage and recycling department in Zurich developed into a state within a state , Filippo Leutenegger , a city council member who has overseen the Sanitation and Recycling office since 2014 , told state broadcaster SRF . We can not allow that to happen , he added , rejecting criticism he failed to act quickly enough to halt the problems . The department s chief , Urs Pauli , was fired in June after revelations he was driving a taxpayer-funded BMW sedan worth more than $ 100,000 and after a so-called secret stash of 215,000 Swiss francs ( $ 226,500 ) was uncovered in his offices . The city prosecutor s office seized the cash , which Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger has reported resulted from selling used department vehicles and was used to reward employees for good performance . SWEEPING COVER-UP According to the city s reports , the garbage department hid 15 million Swiss francs in cost overruns on a logistics center , including by booking them to unrelated accounts in a sweeping cover-up . A whistleblower alerted authorities in 2015 , accusing Pauli s department of neglecting proper documentation as well as irregularities on no-bid construction contracts involving firms with close ties to trash department officials . Awarding contracts without seeking bids or ensuring transparency can prompt questions about compliance when the same contractors are always chosen , according to the city reports . It creates fertile ground for accusations of favoritism . Earlier this year , Leutenegger filed a criminal complaint with city prosecutors , alleging Pauli , who had led the department since 2008 , had broken the law by bypassing formal approval for his BMW . Zurich prosecutors did not immediately respond to questions on Tuesday about their investigation s status . Nobody has been charged . Pauli , who has denied wrongdoing , declined to comment this week through his attorney .',\n",
       " 'COX S BAZAR , Bangladesh/YANGON - Two blasts rocked an area on the Myanmar side of the border with Bangladesh on Monday , accompanied by the sound of gunfire and thick black smoke , as violence that has sent nearly 90,000 Muslim Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh showed no sign of easing . Bangladeshi border guards said a woman lost a leg from a blast about 50 meters inside Myanmar and was carried into Bangladesh to get treatment . reporters heard explosions and saw black smoke rising near a Myanmar village . The latest violence in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25 , when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base . The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh . A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine : a metal disc about 10 centimeters ( 3.94 inches ) in diameter partially buried in the mud . He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground . Bangladeshi border guards said they believed the injured woman stepped on an anti-personnel mine , although that was not confirmed . Two refugees also told they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the blasts which occurred around 2:25 p.m. was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were landmines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army . The spokesman for Myanmar s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi , Zaw Htay , said that a clarification was needed to determine where did it explode , who can go there and who laid those land mines . Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists ? There are so many questions . I would like to say that it is not solid news-writing if you write based on someone talking nonsense on the side of the road , said Zaw Htay . The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi , accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution . The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has come under increasing diplomatic pressure from countries with large Muslim populations such as Turkey and Pakistan to protect Rohingya civilians . Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October . On Monday , reporters saw fires and heard gunshots before the explosions near the Myanmar village of Taung Pyo Let Way . Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force Rohingya out with a campaign of arson and killings . The number of those crossing the border into Bangladesh - 87,000 - surpassed the number who escaped Myanmar after a series of much smaller insurgent attacks last October that set off a military operation . That operation has led to accusations of serious human rights abuses . The newest estimate , based on calculations by U.N. workers in the Bangladeshi border district of Cox s Bazar , takes to about 174,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October . The new arrivals have strained aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar . We are trying to build houses here , but there isn t enough space , said Mohammed Hussein , 25 , who was still looking for a place to stay after fleeing Myanmar four days ago . No non-government organizations came here . We have no food . Some women gave birth on the roadside . Sick children have no treatment . Hundreds of Rohingya milled beside the road while others slung tarpaulins over bamboo frames to make shelters against the monsoon rain . Among new arrivals , about 16,000 are school-age children and more than 5,000 are under the age of five who need vaccine coverage , aid workers said over the weekend . Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan , who said on Friday that violence against Myanmar s Muslims amounted to genocide , last week called Bangladesh s President Abdul Hamid to offer help in sheltering the Rohingya , Dhaka said . Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Suu Kyi and other officials in Myanmar on Monday , to urge a halt to the violence . Suu Kyi s office said Marsudi expressed the Indonesian government s support of the activities of the Myanmar government for the stability , peace and development of Rakhine state . They also discussed humanitarian aid and the two countries would collaborate for the development of the state , Suu Kyi s office said without giving further details . There were more anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta on Monday . Malala Yousafzai , the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , called on Suu Kyi to condemn the shameful treatment of the Rohingya , saying the world is waiting for her to speak out . In addition to tens of thousands of Rohingya , more than 11,700 ethnic residents had been evacuated from northern Rakhine state , the Myanmar government has said , referring to non-Muslims . The army said on Sunday Rohingya insurgents had set fire to monasteries , images of Buddha as well as schools and houses in the north of Rakhine state . It posted images of destroyed Buddha statues .',\n",
       " 'Is Marco Rubio the Republican Obama , or has he been unfairly characterized by his opponents in the GOP ? Wednesday s cover of La Opini n , the nation s largest daily Spanish-language newspaper , prominently portrays donor-class favorite Sen. Marco Rubio with the infamous hope and change imagery that defined Barack Obama s presidential campaign.The cover of the Spanish-language paper writes : The Republican Obama ? The surge of the Latino Senator in the presidential campaign has made him a target of criticism on the subject of immigration . Marco Rubio and Barack Obama share many of the same policy goals , such as Obamatrade and military intervention in Libya , but their most striking similarities are on the subject of immigration . Both men support citizenship for illegal aliens , expanded refugee resettlement , more green cards , more H-1B visas , and large permanent expansions to the rate of immigration and foreign worker importation.Marco Rubio was the co-author of the 2013 Obama-backed immigration bill . Rubio s immigration bill was endorsed by La Raza , the AFL-CIO , SEIU , Rep. Nancy Pelosi , Rep. Luis Gutierrez , Sen. Harry Reid , Mark Zuckerberg , and George Soros . Rubio has not renounced his support for a single policy item outlined in the Gang of Eight bill including his desire to triple green card issuances , double foreign worker visas , and grant citizenship to illegal immigrants.Rubio has even borrowed much of the language of the Obama s campaign prompting Joe Scarborough to mock the young Senator . Following the Iowa caucus , Morning Joe replayed Obama s 2008 acceptance speech celebrating his victory at the Iowa caucus and juxtaposed that with Rubio s strikingly similar Iowa speech celebrating his campaign s ability to inch up to third place . You know , I have said for a year that he is the Republican Obama , Scarborough said . He is the Republican Obama and he just stole the speech In my opinion having somebody with little experience before they become president has not actually been great . SCARBOROUGH TELLS IT LIKE IT IS : In that sense , Rubio is the Obama for Republican donors , but not the Republican Party s actual voters . Indeed , whereas Sen.

Birthers , led by Donald Trump , have for years , accused the president of being foreign born . He s even been accused of being a Muslim , as if being a Muslim is somehow indicative of being something bad . Now , a GOP politician has come out with another accusation : that president Obama has a soft spot for homosexuals because he was once a gay prostitute . Mary Lou Bruner , a retired teacher and a Republican candidate for the Texas State Board of Education said : That s how he paid for his drugs . He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals ; but he hasn t come out of the closet about his own homosexual/bisexual background . What is her evidence ? Well , as is the case with Republicans when they make terrible accusations , they usually have no evidence but they simply play on the fears of people . What s especially troubling about this case is that Bruner s a serious contender for the 15 member education body which already has a vein of lunacy . This is the same body that enacted : Curriculum guidelines requiring students to learn about Confederate heroes , and required teachers to explain the equivalency of Abraham Lincoln s and Jefferson Davis s inaugural addresses , as well as the ways international institutions such as the United Nations threaten U.S. sovereignty . Bruner fits right in with the lunacy and she should be perfect . In the past , she s made other interesting accusations . She s claimed that evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism . She also said that scientists have hidden hard evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time.Despite these crazy accusations and far fetched theories , Bruner is not an anomaly . She has become a standard bearer of the Republican party . Featured image from Wikimedia Commons .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russia ’ s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election , in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump . In his first public appearance since Trump fired him on May 9 , Comey will address the Senate Intelligence Committee in both an open session and behind closed doors , which would allow him to discuss classified information , the committee said on Thursday . Comey was leading the FBI ’ s probe into the allegations , and his firing sparked a political uproar . Facing rising pressure , the Justice Department last month named Robert Mueller , another former FBI chief , as a special counsel to investigate the matter . The Justice Department and multiple U.S. congressional committees are investigating Russia ’ s actions in the 2016 presidential election and questions about possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates . At next week ’ s hearing , Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn , whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny . Controversy erupted again this week after the Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , Devin Nunes , approved subpoenas to the CIA , FBI and National Security Agency for information relating to the “ unmasking ” of the names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts . The White House and Nunes have alleged that former Democratic President Barack Obama ’ s administration eavesdropped on Trump ’ s campaign , an assertion that Comey has disputed and current U.S. officials dismiss as absurd . Four current and former U.S. officials who have reviewed the materials told there was no evidence that political motives drove Obama ’ s aides to request the names be unredacted . “ There is no substance to this , so the only way to look at it is as an attempt to distract the headlines and the public from Comey ’ s public testimony and Mueller ’ s investigation , both of which are serious , ” said one of the U.S. officials familiar with the information Nunes subpoenaed . Committee aides complained Nunes had acted unilaterally , and the top Democrat on the panel , Representative Adam Schiff , said Nunes ’ actions violated his earlier decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe . Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said it appeared that Nunes was “ more concerned with pushing the White House narrative than seeking the truth. ” Trump on Thursday renewed his allegation , without citing evidence , that his campaign communications were monitored , saying in a tweet : “ The big story is the ‘ unmasking and surveillance ’ of people that took place during the Obama administration. ” Nunes followed suit hours later , tweeting : “ Seeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans ’ civil liberties via unmaskings. ” The names of U.S. citizens mentioned in foreign communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies are normally redacted , or “ masked , ” in intelligence reports . The requests to unmask the names of Trump associates underwent the same stringent evaluations that U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require for all such applications , and they produced nothing out of the ordinary , said the four officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity . At most , only one of the requests related to Russia in any way , and the rest pertained to other countries , two of them said . The requests involved between 30 and 40 top-secret reports on intercepted communications in which foreign officials outside the United States mentioned the Trump campaign and people involved in it , the officials said . The reports contained no evidence that any Americans were targets of U.S. eavesdropping operations , they said . Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election , but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their government ’ s involvement . Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign . He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Putin directed an operation that included computer hacking , fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election in Trump ’ s favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton .',\n",
       " 'Texas landowners along the U.S.-Mexico border have begun receiving notices from the federal government saying that they re coming to either buy , or take , parcels of land for Trump s pointless border wall . According to the Texas Observer , landowners are receiving Declarations of Taking notices that offer a price for the piece that the government wants . If the landowners refuse that , then they may see those parts of their property taken via eminent domain.One landowner , Yvette Salinas , got her notice back in January . She d been dreading it for a while because of George W. Bush s focus on a border fence . Under Obama , she d been able to relax a bit because he focused on patrolling and monitoring the border in ways that didn t include taking land and building a wall.Now , with Trump in office , this shit has just gotten real . Whether any of these preparations happened while Obama was still in office or not , it s Trump who is pushing the wall forward as quickly as he can . It s one of his focal points , and it will be his government that buys up or takes the land.The introduction in Salinas letter reads like this : The United States of America is acquiring property along its border with Mexico in order to construct a fence and related improvements designed to secure the border , as required by the Secure Fence Act of 2006 . They offered Salinas and her family $ 2,900 for 1.2 acres of land the same amount for the same land that the government offered her under George W. Bush years earlier . The tiny community in which she lives Los Ebanos lies entirely within the floodplain of the Rio Grande . That land is protected by a treaty with Mexico that forbids the building of structures that could force floodwaters into other communities , and has been an obstacle towards border wall construction.Under Trump , though , Los Ebanos seems to have become a focal point . The government has already completed surveys and planning for a wall there . Despite increasing problems with costs , the fact that crossings are down , and the fact that Republicans are voicing their discomfort with the idea , Trump keeps hammering the wall as the way to secure the border.It s impossibly stupid . People who live along the border prefer the technological surveillance and the presence of the U.S. Border Patrol to a wall because they believe that s more effective and costs a hell of a lot less . And they don t have to give up pieces of land that have been in their families for generations for that.They also know people will still cross whether there s a wall or not.Salinas doesn t want to sell that bit of land but she doesn t know what to do . The community doesn t want to allow the wall to be built through there , either , but neither can they afford to have the U.S. government sue them , and they risk having their land taken without compensation if they try to fight.Featured image by Erik S.

       " 'Conservative columnist Monica Crowley is set for a top role in Donald Trump s administration and it s just been revealed that she plagiarized a massive portion of her 2012 book , stealing from journalists , notable Republicans and even from Wikipedia . Who plagiarizes from Wikipedia , by the way ? She even plagiarized from a statement made by Dick Cheney . Crowley plagiarized more than 50 times in her book What the ( Bleep ) Just Happened , according to an analysis . She literally had to plagiarize in order to be critical of President Obama in her book.We re pretty sure Crowley didn t plagiarize her tweet last year when she wrote , I guess Putin is going to have to do it . RT State Dept Won t Release Clinton Fdn Emails for 27 Months . Crowley was picked by the president-elect to serve as senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council.On Tuesday , publisher HarperCollins said that it will stop selling Crowley s book after the investigation revealed the massive amount of plagiarism in it . The book , which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle , will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material , HarperCollins said.CNN Money reports : A request for comment from the Trump transition team was not immediately returned . A spokesperson for the Trump transition team told CNN s KFile Saturday when the initial report was published that they were standing by Crowley . HarperCollins one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world published her book which has become a national best-seller . Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country , the spokesperson said.It s not just her book . Yesterday , it was revealed that Crowley also lifted , with little to no changes , from other scholarly works without proper attribution in her PhD dissertation at Columbia University and the evidence is overwhelming.Last year , the right wing pundit tweeted out a picture suggesting that the existence of the Berlin Wall was a good thing . Ronald Reagan must be spinning in his grave . That wall symbolized inhumanity and political failure.Republicans are no longer the party of Lincoln or Reagan.Image via screen capture .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Qatar s foreign minister on Friday criticized reckless leadership in the Gulf for a number of crises including the Gulf rift and Lebanon , taking apparent aim at Saudi Arabia . The diplomatic crisis , in which Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have boycotted Qatar , has been brewing since the summer after the four countries cut diplomatic , transport and trade ties with Qatar , accusing it of financing terrorism . Doha denies the charges . Saudi Arabia and its allies are fighting for sway across the region against a bloc led by Iran , which includes the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group . Attention on the dispute has shifted recently especially in the wake of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s shock resignation announcement this month while in Saudi Arabia . Hariri s abrupt resignation and his continued stay in Riyadh have caused fears over Lebanon s stability and thrust it into the bitter rivalry between Riyadh and Iran . Saudi Arabia and Hariri - whom Riyadh backs - say his movements are not restricted . Riyadh also denies accusations it forced Hariri to resign . We see a pattern of irresponsibility and a reckless leadership in the region which is just trying to bully countries into submission , Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in Washington . What we are witnessing now in the region ... it s something we just witness ( ed ) in recent history , bullying small countries into submission . Exactly what happened to Qatar six months ago is happening now to Lebanon . The leadership in Saudi Arabia and the UAE need to understand ... there is no right for any country to interfere in other countries affairs , he told a group of reporters . Asked to comment on those remarks , the Saudi Embassy in Washington s spokeswoman , Fatimah Baeshen , said : The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia s foreign policy has always been premised on regional stability , peace , and security . The Kingdom does not interfere with its neighbors domestic affairs . Riyadh says Qatar backs terrorism and cozies up to Iran . Qatar rejects the accusation and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors backing for authoritarian rulers . Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman rose to power less than three years ago , Riyadh has struck a more aggressive posture towards Iran , launching a war in Yemen , leading the boycott of neighboring Qatar , and ratcheting up its rhetoric against Hezbollah . U.S. efforts to bring an end to the dispute have yet to bear fruit . Qatar hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region which is used in the international coalition fighting Islamic State . Thani said Qatar s Boeing C-17 transport aircraft , used by Doha for logistical support within the coalition , were forced to fly over Iran given that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have blocked Qatari planes from flying over their airspace . So if we imagine that any emergency will happen , those C-17 planes which might have U.S. troops will land in Iran . So this is the impact of this blockade ... on the global coalition and on U.S. military operations there , Thani said . A spokesman for the U.S. Air Forces Central Command said the Qataris have flown nearly 30 mobility missions in support of Coalition operations to defeat ISIS , moving more than a million pounds of cargo , including parts and supplies since Doha recommitted its C-17 fleet to Operation Inherent Resolve in July . At this time , we are aware of no Qatari C-17 flights having traversed Iranian airspace while carrying Coalition cargo , Lt . Colonel Damien Pickart told Reuters .',\n",

       " 'NAIROBI - Administrators closed Kenya s oldest university on Tuesday , citing fears for students safety in a planned protest over police beatings at a campus demonstration last week . Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups , but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted . Despite this , Kenya , an economic and transport hub in East Africa and a key Western ally in a volatile region , receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors , including the United States and Britain . Rights groups say at least 28 people were killed , mostly by police , in unrest following the Aug. 8 election , whose results were later nullified by the Supreme Court due to irregularities . A re-run of the presidential vote is scheduled for Oct. 26 and the conduct of the police will be closely watched . On Sept. 28 , University of Nairobi students protested against the arrest of an opposition lawmaker . Police responded by entering dormitories and classrooms , dragging out students , beating them with clubs and firing tear gas , according to a witness . The university said 27 students were injured . A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment but a presidential spokesman told local radio on Monday that robbers were hiding among the students . On Tuesday , students had planned to demonstrate against the beatings but instead administrators shut down the university . The ( University of Nairobi ) Senate has decided to send the students home for their ( own ) safety , John Orindi , the university s corporate affairs director , told Reuters . On Tuesday morning , riot policemen stood near a truck with water cannon outside the campus gates . A 20-year-old veterinary student who did not want to be named for fear of retribution said students wanted the vice chancellor to resign for allowing anti-riot police to enter campus and seriously injure students . University officials had talks on Monday with the interior minister , police chief and the head of a Kenyan government watchdog that is charged with investigating complaints against the police .',\n",
       " 'A fellow multi-billionaire from New York and neighbor to none other than Donald Trump has already laid the groundwork for entering into the 2016 presidential race . That person is Michael Bloomberg and this time , he s not only flirting with the possibility , but he s also considering throwing in $ 1 billion of his own money to make it happen . While that may be a lot of dough for the Donald ( a sizeable percentage at least ) for Bloomberg , it s practically nothing.The former Mayor of New York is no stranger to politics , either , having served in the position for 11 years , and he s worth an estimated $ 37.2 billion . That makes him the 12th richest person in the world today , according to Forbes . If anyone could make a dent in the race , it s him.He would have to run as an independent , for sure , and while the chances of him winning would be slim to none taking that path , here s what s more important : Bloomberg entering the race would be a straight-up disaster for Democrats , to say the least . And , it makes you start to think along these terms ; is a billionaire going to buy the presidency this go around , for a fellow New York billionaire ? Mr . Bloomberg says he would be in it to win it , but let s look at the numbers : The Washington Examiner did a poll already on this and had Trump winning in a three-way race if Clinton gets the nomination . Trump would receive around 37 percent of the vote to Clinton s 36 percent while Bloomberg would only tally 13 percent . While it s possible there could still be a Clinton win within the margin of error , it opens up a path for a Trump win , period . Just giving Trump a possible win is enough to make this scary.The elections department at the Huffington Post has a vast array of polls pitting Clinton against Trump , going back months . Guess what , Clinton has won in a head to head matchup against the Donald in 23 out of the last 28 conducted . That s an overwhelming amount . It s safe the say that having an independent of Bloomberg s stature running is something Democrats would rather end up avoiding.Why Bloomberg thinks he would have a chance in this thing , other than to hand the presidency over to the GOP is beyond us . But according to several sources in his camp , he s apparently hoping that Bernie Sanders takes some key early states , at which case he could step in around an early March time frame . If Bernie takes momentum away from Clinton , Bloomberg thinks he has a chance . Here s what that tells us : Bloomberg could take even more votes away from the Democratic Party he thinks anyways than he would from the Republican Party were Sanders to win the nomination . That doesn t look good , either.His record backs that up , too : he s pro-gun control , pro-abortion , recognizes climate control is a huge problem , is for immigration reform ; in practically every social view he leans to the left . The only thing that hurts him with Democrats is the fact that he has close ties to Wall Street and has a lot of business views that aren t exactly great for poor people.Even Trump wouldn t mind Bloomberg jumping in . The New York Times even made it the title of their latest article announcing the news : Donald Trump Would Love to See Michael Bloomberg Run . I would love to see Michael run I would love the competition . I d love to see what would happen . ( We run ) different kinds of business , it s a very different kind of business , but I would say that if he ran , I d be very happy about it . He s not the only one either who sees Bloomberg running as a gold mine for Trump . Alan Patricof , a financier and longtime donor to the Clintons , said it would be a terrible thing for the Democratic Party if the former Mayor decides to run as an independent . If it was President Trump or President Bloomberg , I d certainly rather have President Bloomberg . But , it certainly can t help the Democrats . Mr. Patricof might prefer Bloomberg , but that doesn t mean Bloomberg would come out ahead . Ari Fleischer , a former White House Press Secretary for President George W. Bush says this would be a godsend for his party . Bloomberg s entry into the race would be a dream come true for Republicans . He would draw mostly from the Democratic column . I hope he runs . If there s one thing we know , Bloomberg is no idiot . If he enters the race , he must know he d only be doing a favor for Trump . And , that on the face of it , doesn t make him an enemy of Donald Trump . If anything , it would make them best friends , no matter what they d like voters to think of their relationship to one another.Featured image via Wikipedia',\n",
       " \"Grab your popcorn , everybody ! The Tea Party civil war has kicked off with an all-out battle of stupid between Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.Their feud has raged largely under the radar since September when Beck fired the first salvo by calling the former half-term Alaska Governor a clown for talking to Donald Trump during an anti-Iran rally . I m going to say it , Beck announced . I don t care what Sarah Palin says any more . Sarah Palin has become a clown . I m embarrassed that I was once for Sarah Palin . Honestly , I m embarrassed I don t know who she is any more , I don t know what she stands for . I saw a clip of her talking to Donald Trump . What the hell is that ? I don t even know who she is any more . As we all know by now , Beck is a HUGE supporter of Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz , so of course that means anybody who doesn t support Cruz is dead to Beck . And that included Palin.And when America s village idiot actually endorsed Trump in an incoherent rant that left everybody craving a Yosemite Sam cartoon , Beck went nuclear on Facebook . Sarah Palin . Small Government , lower taxes , fewer regulations and the constitution ? Not any more . Big government Sad excuse to abandon principles . Just because things don t go my way , I don t abandon God . Saul Alinsky is wrong . The ends do not justify the means . But wait ! There s more ! After a week in which Beck appeared with Cruz to get all teary eyed about Murica and how Cruz will rule the land with God on his right shoulder whispering in his ear what to do , Palin fired back at her former friend on Thursday.Writing on her Facebook page about Beck s love affair with a man she once shared the Tea Party with , Palin went after Beck on several fronts and did not show any mercy whatsoever . Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner , Glenn Beck , promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life , pro-2nd amendment , pro-growth , pro-American GOP front runner what s conservative about that ? Palin began in reference to Beck saying he would support Bernie Sanders before he ever supports Trump.Then she pointed out that Beck once said that John McCain would have been worse for the country than President Obama.Palina also slammed Beck for proclaiming his hatred of the American victims of the 9/11 terrorists attacks , and then attacked Beck and Cruz for greeting immigrants at the border.In conclusion , Palin wrote : Beck is known for his continuous mocking of Americans who may disagree with his puzzling antics , while crying just last night , Why mock ME ? what s consistent about that ? Beck will go ballistic after reading this post and will ramp up his unjustified attacks against Donald Trump , me , my faith , and you for acknowledging all this I ve outlined , in his own words what s smart about that ?

       " 'Mexico does not like Donald Trump , and for good reason . He s accused their people of being rapists and killers , said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with , and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for . One Mexican literary magazine , called Letras Libres , decided to illustrate what they think of Trump after all of this . Their October issue features him on the cover , and it s not in a flattering light : En nuestro n mero de octubre : pic.twitter.com/xhMFnU9ttR Letras Libres ( @ Letras_Libres ) September 28 , 2016That stache is reminiscent of Hitler s mustache and reads fascista Americana , or , American fascist . Suffice it to say , the editors at Letras Libres aren t thrilled with Trump , either.One expert on the history of fascism said that Trump s nonstop , offensive ethnic stereotyping , and his fear-the-foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism . Mexico is a foreign country . Their people are foreigners , and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs , both inside and outside our borders . He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline , when it isn t , is likewise textbook fascism . He s got the entire world worried , confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle , and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there , but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax . Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there , but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country , even though they don t have to pay it here . Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up . Trump doesn t know what he s talking about . But that is , in fact , just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us , and must be stopped.In other words , Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is . He may not quite be Hitler or Mussolini ( yet , mostly because he s not in charge yet ) , but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'SYDNEY - Australians turned in 51,000 illegal firearms , ranging from 19th-century weapons to a rocket launcher , during a three-month amnesty that ended on Friday , and which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said had helped avert Las Vegas-style mass shootings . The cache , representing about a fifth of illegal firearms , was collected during Australia s second amnesty since its worst ever massacre , when a lone gunman killed 35 people in the island state of Tasmania in 1996 . There has not been a mass shooting since the then conservative government banned all semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic shotguns that year , and introduced tougher background checks on gun purchases . The firearms gathered in this year s amnesty will be destroyed . Those who still own such guns face jail time , and the government is pushing for harsher penalties for gun traffickers . Every single one of those 51,000 guns could be used , could have been used in a crime where Australians could be killed - now they can t , Turnbull told reporters in Sydney . The killer there had a collection of semi-automatic weapons which a person in his position would simply not be able to acquire in Australia , he added . Turnbull was referring to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history , when Stephen Paddock , 64 , armed with numerous assault rifles , fired this week on an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas , killing 58 people and himself . The attack has focused attention on gun ownership rules in the United States , and in Australia , where gun ownership restrictions are seen to have worked . In Tasmania in 1996 , Martin Bryant killed 35 people at the former prison colony of Port Arthur , using military-style weapons bought without background checks . In response , conservative Prime Minister John Howard convinced Australia s eight provincial governments to toughen their laws , despite opposition from his own side of the political divide . Rapid-fire guns were outlawed , and a national licensing system required gun sellers and buyers to register , and specify reasons - such as gun club membership - why they needed weapons . The measures provoked opposition from gun owners , in particular farmers , but has since mostly vanished , because Australia s rules are seen to have worked . You can t just buy a gun , said Phillip Alpers , a firearms injury researcher at the University of Sydney , adding that potential purchasers faced a full background check by police . They will ask you for a genuine reason for owning a firearm , he added . If you can t ( provide one ) , you won t get the gun . Australia s few gun stores are heavily regulated , in contrast with the United States , where ammunition and weapons are sold at chain stores , such as Walmart .',\n",
       " 'Sean Spicer is the former communications man for the Republican National Committee . He will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming Trump Administration , and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of Trump s ongoing feud with the press . Speaking with The Hill , Spicer whined about how the media treats Trump . He began : There s some positive aspects here and there , but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves . I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway , and inside pundit-world , they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are . They continue to mock him in ways , when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the American people are and what they think . Spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of Democrats in the press , saying : There are countless examples of the media engaging overtly or covertly cheering on Democrats and there s no accountability . But it s also not even frowned upon . The thing is , though , the press realizes what the Republican Party doesn t , which is that Trump is a petty , vengeful , lying , unqualified , corrupt Russian stooge who has duped just enough Americans in the right states to be elected president . That does not mean that he is deserving of respect , though . In fact , respect is earned , not given , and Trump has shown the media zero respect . Rightfully , they are giving it back in kind . He has not earned their respect , and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him.Spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with Trump , saying that the White House press briefings that they and the American people have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a Trump White House : It will be a daily something . When I say something , maybe it s a gaggle , maybe it s an on-camera briefing . Maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions because they can t afford to be in Washington but they still have a question . Maybe we just let the American people submit questions that we read off as well . This is most definitely vague , and when it comes to vague with Team Trump , that is an ominous sign , most likely.Spicer then said that he had spoken with former White House press secretaries , from both major parties , and said of them : Whether Republican or Democrat , every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time , counsel and advice . The respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them . Speaking of former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised , Spicer said : I think his conclusion his points are right . The second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative . So , in other words , they want to cut the American people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government . The talk then turned to Trump s insistence on using Twitter for insults , policy announcements , and everything in between . Many Americans including Trump s own supporters believe he needs to stay off Twitter . Spicer , however , scoffed at this notion : I think this is nonsense . I really do . Because at the end of the day the American people want more than anything else is results . And success . And he s delivering already . And I think the American people the people who have their jobs because of his actions the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars , are appreciative , and I m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that . So , in other words , we can look forward to the Tweeter-in-Chief . We already knew that , though . Spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press : Journalists and everyone in America has a Constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write . But he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight , the facts are known , and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable . So , this war with the media will continue for the next four years . Considering Trump s thin-skinned , vengeful , vindictive nature , this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the White House to bully journalists and dismantle the First Amendment . Scary times indeed , folks . # RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'ALBANY , New York - A New York judge on Thursday withheld judgment until Monday morning on a challenge from two New York residents seeking to remove Senator Ted Cruz from the state ’ s primary ballot for the presidential primary because of his birth in Canada . The plaintiffs objected to Cruz ’ s inclusion in the ballot for the state ’ s April 19 primary election for the Republican party ’ s presidential nomination , claiming the senator from Texas is constitutionally ineligible to assume the White House . New York Supreme Court Judge David Weinstein promised to decide if the case will proceed by Monday . He said the objectors , Barry Korman , 81 , of Manhattan , and William Gallo , 85 , of Manhasset , Long Island , could argue the merits later next week if he decides they have standing . Republican front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned Cruz ’ s eligibility for the White House , and residents in Alabama , Pennsylvania and Texas have filed legal challenges to block him from appearing on the ballot . An Illinois judge dismissed a similar challenge there this week on a technicality . Some legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the U.S. will block Cruz ’ s presidential run . In their Feb. 19 petition , the two New York residents attached a birth certificate for Cruz , showing he was born in December 1970 in Calgary , Alberta , in Canada , and arguing he was not “ naturally born ” in the United States as the Constitution dictates for any U.S. president . Cruz has said he is eligible to run because of his mother ’ s U.S. citizenship . His father is a Cuban immigrant . Lawyer Grant Lally , appearing for Cruz in Albany , said the judge should dismiss the case because the objectors missed a deadline to file their petition , and added the matter is a federal , not a state , issue . Roger J. Bernstein , a lawyer for the objectors , said the challenge needed a judge ’ s attention . “ The voters of the Republican Party need clarity , ” he said .

       " 'KIEV - Outgoing U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called on Monday for sanctions on Russia to stay , urging the world to stand up to its “ coercion and aggression ” after President-elect Donald Trump mooted ending the measures under a possible deal with Moscow . Speaking on a swan song visit to Kiev , Biden said the G7 nations and European Union should lift the sanctions only after Russia had fully implemented a peace deal on ending a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine and returned control of Crimea . Trump , who will be inaugurated on Friday , raised the prospect that he would propose offering to end the sanctions imposed over Russia ’ s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its role in the rebellion in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal . Without mentioning Trump , Biden appeared to take issue with the President-elect ’ s comments made in an interview published in Monday ’ s edition of the Times of London . “ The international community must continue to stand as one against Russian coercion and aggression , ” he told reporters , standing alongside Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko . Biden stressed the 2015 deal on ending the rebellion by pro-Russian insurgents which is still continuing , with Washington accusing Moscow of failing to keep its side of the bargain . “ Together with our EU and G7 partners , we made it clear that sanctions should remain in place until Russia fully , emphasize fully , implements its commitments under the Minsk agreement , ” he said , adding that Crimea-related sanctions must also stay “ until Russia returns full control to the people of Ukraine ” . U.S. support for Ukraine has contributed to a deterioration in relations with Russia to their worst since the Cold War . Under President Barack Obama , Washington has invested heavily in helping Kiev make a success of a 2013-2014 uprising which forced a Kremlin-backed leader to flee and installed the pro-Western opposition in power . Trump ’ s open admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and stated desire to improve bilateral ties have stoked fears in Kiev that U.S. resolve to hold Russia to account could waver . Biden has mixed support with some tough talking about Ukraine ’ s patchy efforts in tackling graft , and has previously warned that international help is conditional on Kiev making good on promises to tackle endemic bribe-taking . “ You ’ re fighting ... the cancer of corruption , ” Biden , who leaves office on Jan. 20 along with Obama , said on Monday . Poroshenko said Ukraine believed in good cooperation with the new U.S. administration and urged sanctions to stay , without mentioning Trump ’ s remarks on a deal with Russia . A Kremlin spokesman said it was too early to comment . Biden has been the front man for U.S. policy towards Ukraine , visiting Kiev five times since the change in power and maintaining such regular telephone contact with Ukrainian officials that he has joked he talks to them more than his wife . As Biden left the room , a journalist asked if he thought the Trump administration would give Ukraine the same priority as he had . Biden gave a thumbs up and said : “ Hope springs eternal. ” Continued Western support is vital for Ukraine . The economy , which has been badly hit by the war in the east , is slowly emerging from two years of recession but remains dependent on external financial help . The United States has so far provided over $ 3 billion and said it could offer more , provided reform efforts continue . Andy Hunder , the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine , said Kiev would have to put much time and resources into dealing with the new U.S. administration . “ On Jan. 20 Ukraine will be waking up to a new reality , ” he told Reuters . “ There is a concern in Kiev about how the new relationship will develop . It will require building new bridges to the influencers , the gatekeepers and decision-makers. ” Kiev has already taken steps to win the good favor of the those calling the shots in the Trump administration . Days after his election in November , Poroshenko ’ s office started planning an official visit to Washington in early 2017 . The Ukrainian government has hired former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour and his lobbying firm BGR Group to lobby U.S. politicians and arrange meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials . This is not to say that Ukraine lacks senior political advocates in the United States . A bipartisan group of U.S. senators , including John McCain and Marco Rubio , said last week they wanted to slap a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Ukraine and Syria . A sanctions bill with similar provisions is being written in the House of Representatives . “ Our job is to make sure this attention on Ukraine does not wane , ” Ukraine ’ s Ambassador to the United States , Valeriy Chaliy said on Wednesday .',\n",
       " 'UPDATE ON THE REDSKINS BATTLE WITH THE FEDS : ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( AP ) A federal judge has ordered the Patent and Trademark Office to cancel registration of the Washington Redskins trademark , ruling that the team name may be disparaging to Native Americans.The ruling Wednesday by Judge Gerald Bruce Lee affirms an earlier finding by an administrative appeal board.In his 70-page ruling , Lee emphasized that the organization is still free to use the name if it wishes the team would just lose some legal protections that go along with federal registration of a trademark.The team had sued to overturn a ruling against it by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board . The team argued that cancellation of its trademark infringed on its free-speech rights because it required the government to judge whether the name is offensive.The organization can appeal.Via : scrippsmediaThe left is holding hostage new construction of the Washington Redskins stadium for a petty desire to get their way . Demanding a name change from the Redskins to something they consider more pc is total bs . The American Indians who have already responded in favor of keeping the team name understand the name isn t offensive and understand the history behind the name . This is just more of Obama s effort to cleanse our nation of anything HE deems offensive.Efforts to lure the Washington Redskins back to the District have come up against a potentially insurmountable challenge : the Obama administration s objections to the team s name.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this spring that the National Park Service , which owns the land beneath Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium , was unlikely to accommodate construction of a new stadium for the Redskins unless the team changes its name.Jewell oversees both national park land and America s trust and treaty relationships with Native American tribes.Her decision not to extend the District s lease of the RFK land badly hinders Bowser s bid to return the Redskins to D.C. and boosts efforts to lure the team across the Potomac to Northern Virginia.Since joining the Obama administration two years ago , Jewell has repeatedly echoed the president s concern that the name is offensive to Native Americans . Last fall she called the name a relic of the past that should be changed . Personally , I think we would never consider naming a team the Blackskins or the Brownskins or the Whiteskins . So , personally , I find it surprising that in this day and age , the name is not different , Jewell told ABC News.Jewell reiterated that position with Bowser ( D ) at an April 27 meeting , telling the mayor that she was unlikely to rework the lease terms for a stadium in part because of the team s name , according to a Department of the Interior spokeswoman , Jessica Kershaw.Team owner Daniel Snyder , who insists that the moniker honors Native Americans , has vowed never to change it.Bowser , jockeying with Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe ( D ) to land the team s new stadium , had inquired with Park Service officials about extending the District s lease for the RFK property to allow for a new stadium . Extending the lease would also require congressional action . [ Tug of war for new Redskins stadium is complicated by name debate ] Jewell did mention in that meeting that she was uncomfortable with the name , Kershaw said . The president has said something similar , that he is uncomfortable with the name , and she clearly clarified that position . Read more : WaPo',\n",
       " '- Below are the highlights from Reuters ’ Oct. 25 exclusive interview with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump . “ ( Hillary Clinton ) has no plan for Syria . Look , with her you ’ ll end up in World War Three . She doesn ’ t know what she ’ s doing , just like with Libya , just like with everything else she ’ s done . So Syria now is no longer Syria . Syria is Russia and the new Iran that we built through the Iran deal , which is one of the worst negotiated deals I ’ ve ever seen . So you ’ re not fighting Syria anymore , you ’ re fighting Syria , Russia and Iran , alright . Russia is a nuclear country , but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk. ” “ I say the first thing we have to do is get rid of ISIS before we start thinking about Syria. ” “ ( Syrian President Bashar al- ) Assad is secondary , to me , to ISIS. ” “ If Hillary Clinton ended the war and left troops behind , we wouldn ’ t even be fighting for Mosul right now , OK. She gave them Mosul . She didn ’ t know what she was doing . The woman is incompetent. ” “ One of the reasons we were going in was to get the ISIS leaders . But if that ’ s the case , why didn ’ t we go in as a surprise attack instead of - you know , with the element of surprise - instead of announcing three months ago that we ’ re going into Mosul ? ” “ I would hope to have a good relationship with Russia . And I would hope to have a good relationship with Putin . “ I ’ m not friends or enemies with the Russians . I have nothing to do Russia. ” “ ( Clinton ) always casts Putin as a bad guy and a bad light . If she won , how is she going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil . He ’ s not going to want to negotiate with her , number one . Number two , I don ’ t believe he has any respect for Hillary Clinton whatsoever . On Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte saying he was against the presence of any foreign troops in his country : “ He probably made a deal with China ... He ’ s dealing with China and Russia so he probably made a deal with China and Russia. ” “ The Philippines are a very important strategic location . He has no respect or liking of Obama ... ” “ I think it ’ s a horrible thing that the United States is reduced to being thrown out of a country. ” “ There ’ s a big group of people that are in that category ( of world leaders who dislike Obama ) because Obama wants to focus on his golf game . He doesn ’ t want to take the time necessary to get along with people . It ’ s too bad. ” Wikileaks on Tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of Clinton ’ s campaign manager , John Podesta , that shows her Democratic presidential campaign reacting after President Barack Obama said in a television interview that he learned of her private email server through news reports . Trump ’ s response : “ Well , I now see why the president stuck up for Hillary , because he didn ’ t want to be dragged into it ... Because he knew all about her private server. ” “ This is a big thing . This means that he has to be investigated. ” “ Thousands of people are standing there to vote . I think those people are very , very disappointed that the leaders ( of the Republican Party ) aren ’ t helping us win. ” “ I know this : If the leaders were helping me , we couldn ’ t lose this election . It would be an impossibility. ” “ The media ’ s rigging the system . It ’ s never been a pile on like this ... I mean , they ’ re rigging the polls . The polls are ridiculous . Look at that one poll that came out , ABC/Washington Post . That was a Democratic poll . They ’ re rigging the system. ” An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton leading Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters .',\n",

       " 'BRUSSELS - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reassured his nervous European counterparts over Washington ’ s commitment to NATO on Friday and pressed them again to spend more on defense , triggering a rebuke from Germany . Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was neither “ reachable nor desirable ” for Germany to spend the agreed NATO target of two percent of member states ’ economic output on defense . NATO allies have until 2024 to do that . “ Two percent would mean military expenses of some 70 billion euros . I don ’ t know any German politician who would claim that is reachable nor desirable , ” Gabriel told the first meeting of NATO foreign ministers attended by Tillerson . “ The United States will realize it is better to talk about better spending instead of more spending , ” he said , noting that humanitarian , development and economic aid to stabilize countries and regions should also count . In his first remarks to NATO ministers , Tillerson said allies needed to pay up or outline plans for meeting that target when NATO leaders meet on May 25 for the first top-level summit of the alliance to be attended by U.S. President Donald Trump . Trump has criticized NATO as “ obsolete ” and suggested Washington ’ s security guarantees for European allies could be conditional on them spending more on their own defense . He has also said he wants NATO to do more to fight terrorism . “ Our goal should be to agree at the May leaders meeting that by the end of the year all allies will have either met the pledge guidelines or will have developed plans that clearly articulate how ... the pledge will be fulfilled , ” Tillerson said . “ Allies must demonstrate by their actions that they share U.S. government ’ s commitment. ” In Berlin , German government spokesman , Steffen Seibert , said the government was committed to increasing defense spending and would continue to do so “ because we know it is necessary and makes sense to further strengthen our armed forces ” . U.S. defense expenditure makes up about 70 percent of the total NATO allies ’ defense spending . Only four European NATO members - Estonia , Greece , Poland and Britain - meet the two-percent target . NATO head Jens Stoltenberg rejected Gabriel ’ s call to include non-military spending toward the goal , but said Germany was moving “ in the right direction ” with more military spending after years of cuts . He said NATO ministers on Friday discussed national plans for arriving at the target as they prepared for the May summit . In London , Britain ’ s Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that other European NATO allies must “ raise their game , and those failing to meet the two-percent commitment ... should at least agree to year-on-year real terms increases. ” Tillerson did , however , offer assurances of Washington ’ s commitment to NATO during his brief stop in Brussels , where he did not hold one-on-one meetings with countries , which is customary during such gatherings . His initial decision to skip his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers had added to questions about the Trump administration ’ s commitment . The meeting was later rescheduled and he attended on Friday . “ The United States is committed to ensuring NATO has the capabilities to support our collective defense , ” Tillerson said . “ We will uphold the agreements we have made to defend our allies. ” Tillerson said NATO was fundamental to countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and said the United States would hold Moscow accountable to its commitments under a two-year Minsk ceasefire deal . He pledged to keep sanctions in place against Moscow until it complies with the Minsk agreement . Trump has said in the past that , as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia , he is prepared to review the sanctions , which were imposed by Barack Obama over Russia ’ s 2014 annexation of Ukraine ’ s Crimea Peninsula . “ We do not , and will not , accept Russian efforts to change the borders of territory of Ukraine , ” Tillerson said according to a transcript of his remarks . “ The United States sanctions will remain until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered our sanctions , ” he added , expressing alarm at a surge in violence along the front lines in eastern Ukraine . Stoltenberg said ties between European NATO members and the United States were “ rock solid ” . He said “ fair burden sharing to keep the trans-atlantic bond strong ” and “ stepping up NATO efforts to project stability and fight terrorism ” were on the agenda on Friday as the bloc seeks to respond to the new , harsher tone from across the Atlantic .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax . Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano , president and CEO of ADM , who spoke in favor of the proposal . The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul . Target is a big importer of goods , while ADM exports . House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax , which is estimated to garner $ 1 trillion , will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits , but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent . Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax . “ Under the new border adjustment tax , American families – your constituents – would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less , ” Cornell told the committee . Luciano , on the other hand , argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive . “ A competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and , from a tax perspective , ever strengthening competition from abroad , ” he said . The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous , especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it . Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours , including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports . Dimming the prospects more , lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year , and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform . The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax , including William Simon , the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc , who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax , endorsed the measure . “ We will see more good middle class jobs , a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution , ” Simon said . Lawrence Lindsey , the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush , also supported the tax . Economist Kimberly Clausing , of Reed College , criticized the proposal , saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing . “ This is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime , ” she said .',\n",
       " 'While Donald Trump may have spent a lot of time dissing President Barack Obama during his presidential campaign , he has definitely changed his tone likely because he knows how incredibly screwed he is if Obama doesn t hold his little orange hands during this transition process.On Wednesday , Trump horrified the entire Republican Party by showering praise on our current president and even said that he thinks so highly of our current Commander in Chief that he has taken some of Obama s advice on his future cabinet . During an interview on The Today Show , Trump touched on several subjects , but his most shocking statements were his kind words about Obama . Trump , who rarely takes advice from anyone but himself , said : I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing and in one case have appointed where he thought very highly of that person . I love getting his ideas . And I may differ in many cases , I differ very greatly . It s safe to say that the one person Trump says Obama thought very highly of might be another one of Trump s lies , or there might be a small chance that at least one of the people in Trump s cabinet isn t a white supremacist ( hopefully ) . And Trump continued , as he just couldn t stop gushing about Obama : I really like him . We have a really good chemistry together . I ve asked him what he thinks are the biggest problems , greatest assets We have very good dialogue . We wonder if Obama would say the same . You can watch Trump kiss up to Obama below , with his comments starting at about the 9:30 mark : You can only imagine how much this is going to bother the rest of the Republican Party.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Just when you think things can t get any more absurd than they already are , Republicans go and prove you wrong . Now , in the state of Michigan , Republicans are pushing for a law that would allow law-abiding citizens to carry concealed pistols without a government-issued permit . Who are these legislators that are introducing such absurd legislation ? Michigan Reps. Tom Barrett , R-Potterville ; Lee Chatfield , R-Levering ; Triston Cole , R-Mancelona ; and Jim Runestad , R-White Lake.In HB 5301 , it states : A person shall not carry a dagger , dirk , stiletto , a double-edged nonfolding stabbing instrument of any length , or any other dangerous weapon OTHER THAN A PISTOL , except a hunting knife adapted and carried as such , concealed on or about his or her person , or whether concealed or otherwise in any vehicle operated or occupied by the person , except in his or her dwelling house , IN HIS OR HER place of business , or on other land possessed by the person . To summarize , knives bad , guns good . Makes sense , right ? According to MLive : Cole , author of House Bill 5304 , said the current Concealed Pistol License permit requirement in Michigan is a government over-reach that places an undue burden on residents who want to defend themselves against criminals . Criminals don t have to go through a training class and wait for government permission to have a handgun before they commit armed robbery , yet a law-abiding citizen who simply wants the option of self-defense has to jump through all the hoops and pay a price to carry a concealed weapon , he said in a prepared statement . People who want to ensure the safety of their families against the criminal element should not have to beg for that right , Cole said . Here s a reminder for Triston Cole : guns safety laws are not government overreach . In fact , the Second Amendment calls for a well regulated ( ie . well-trained and maintained ) militia . The founders didn t write well regulated for no reason . They knew an armed populace also needs to be held under certain laws , restrictions and training . If getting a gun permit and/or training is too hard for some folks , maybe they shouldn t have guns , because they apparently don t have the mental capacity to seek a proper permit . This sort of vigilante justice is exactly what s wrong with parts of America . We need more laws , not fewer , and we definitely don t need a bunch of people just going out , buying guns , and carrying them wherever they like.It s amazing , really . Guns and gun owners in Michigan are about to have more rights than women , and the LGBT community . Apparently , sodomy is to be labeled a felony in the state and punishable by up to 15 years in prison . And as far as abortion rights for women , here are the restrictions in Michigan : Keep in mind , abortion is legal nationwide , and has been since 1973.It is absolutely outrageous how these Republicans will say that going to get a gun permit is government overreach , yet in the same breath go in to people s bedrooms and call them a felon , or into a woman s uterus and call her a murderer.They definitely have their priorities backwards , and should be condemned for this outrageous way of thinking.Featured image : Wikimedia Commons',\n",

       " 'Kansas economy is imploding , but rather than fix it by repealing his disastrous tax cuts , Governor Sam Brownback wants to raid the state investment fund instead.When Brownback gave a massive tax giveaway to big business and wealthy residents , he destroyed the state government s ability to generate revenues to pay for things like education , which has suffered greatly ever since.The budget shortfall is projected to stand at $ 930 million by 2018 and it just keeps getting bigger.Brownback and his Republican allies in the state legislature have been desperately trying to fill the massive gap by any means , including auctioning off sex toys and making deep education cuts.In other words , Kansas Republicans refuse to admit they made a mistake by slashing taxes the way they did and basically will do anything to fill the budget hole except reversing the tax cuts.A new idea Republicans have is to raid the state investment fund , which currently stands at over $ 300 million from money the state put aside to grow with investments in the stock market . This money is supposed to go toward paying for needs the state may have in the future.According to the Wichita Eagle , One source of money that the governor is eyeing is a long-term investment fund , according to Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning , R-Overland Park.Denning said the governor plans on using the roughly $ 360 million fund to get out of the crisis for the next six months without having to do deep , deep cuts to K-12 . The governor s on board and all the budget folks are on board , Denning continued . And all the legislators that have read about it that I ve talked to they re on board because they know that if we don t do this one-time money with such a short time frame left in fiscal year 17 that we d have to take almost that entire cut to K-12 . There s no other place to go . You ve got to take your hat off that they ve looked under another sofa cushion and found another one-time solution . But this one , I think , is important , and I think all the legislators will support it . But that s not true . GOP state Senator Carolyn McGinn , who is the new chair of the Budget Committee , said the idea sounds like a shady pay-day loan . It looks to me like we re taking a payday loan , she said . We re borrowing against ourselves again internally , and I think it s just going to put us further away from where we need to get to . Indeed , Brownback and his GOP allies apparently think the only answer to fix their mess is to steal government money from other programs , including money from a tobacco settlement that funds children s programs . They re even considering doubling taxes on people who make under $ 30,000 a year which would squeeze low income families even more in a state that is waging war on food stamps.The state investment fund would only be a temporary fix for the current fiscal year because while it would close the current $ 350 million gap , an even bigger gap of $ 580 million would need to be plugged after July , when the next fiscal year begins . Plus , they would have to pay back the fund if they choose to pay it back at all , which would mean the people of Kansas lose that long-term investment into their state s future.In short , Republicans need to admit they screwed up and reverse Brownback s disastrous tax cuts for the wealthy and big business so they can get their fiscal house in order again without resorting to stealing money from children and the poor.Kansas Republicans should be embarrassed about the budget crisis they caused and they should rectify it by admitting that trickle-down economics do NOT work and reinstate the taxes that should never have been cut in the first place . It s time for big business and the wealthy to start paying their fair share again to save Kansas from utter financial ruin.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. Education Department has left thousands of student-loan borrowers who were defrauded by Corinthian Colleges Inc in limbo by prolonging a process created by the Obama administration that was supposed to speedily cancel their debts , according to 20 state attorneys general and regulators . In the final months that President Barack Obama , a Democrat , was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for-profit colleges such as Corinthian and ITT Tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law . In a letter sent on Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off . The letter , signed by the top lawyers of Illinois , California , Massachusetts and other states , was released on Tuesday . They said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened . According to the letter , the Department stated in January it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days , but in many cases loans have not been canceled . That means some of Corinthian ’ s students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection . Work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway , according to Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill . “ We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible , ” Hill said in a statement . “ Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks. ” Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said about 5,000 past Corinthian students in the state received letters last December directing to apply on-line for relief . Since then , his office has received queries about delays in the process . “ Delay in canceling this debt , especially for students who have already been approved , could put even greater financial strain on students in Virginia and around the country , ” he said in a statement . Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates , for-profit Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools .',\n",

As he posed for pictures , a woman wearing a Pride Center of Staten Island t-shirt approached him and said she wanted to ask him a question . She said : I have a quick question . Do you think I chose to be gay ? Carson was taken completely off guard and repeated her question back to her , avoiding a clear answer as many others looked on . He replied , Did you choose to be gay ? That s a long conversation . Fully aware that the answer really wasn t that complicated , the activist walked away but not before telling Carson , I think you re full of sh * t. You can watch the Carson squirm in the footage below : WATCH : @ realBenCarson confronted at Staten Island town hall : Do you think I chose to be gay ? https : //t.co/gL3N7TXpO1 ABC News Politics ( @ ABCPolitics ) January 5 , 2016Like many of his fellow Republicans , Carson s rhetoric is plagued by anti-gay remarks . Carson clearly expressed his stance on whether or not he felt homosexuality was a choice when he spoke to CNN s Chris Cuomo in March . Cuomo had asked Carson what his opinion was on the matter and Carson s unwavering response was : Absolutely . Because a lot of people who go into prison , go into prison straight , and when they come out they re gay . So , did something happen while they were in there ? Ask yourself that question . Carson has said plenty of other equally ridiculous things about the LGBT community as well . In the past , he s likened homosexuals to pedophiles and those who engage in bestiality , and claimed that God thinks being gay is an abomination . And despite all his anti-LGBT comments and attempts to make sure that the LGBT community doesn t get the same rights as heterosexuals , Carson still has the nerve to say gay people are more protected than Christians.Featured image video screen capture',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says President Trump is drifting further into Neoconservative land , and very soon there will be no turning back.Although you wouldn t know it from the US media blackout the US has quietly deployed upwards of 4,000 combat troops in Syria in total violation of both US and international law.Upon closer examination , however , Trump s foreign policy is fast resembling Israel s foreign policy.This is exactly what candidate Trump promised he wouldn t do Doug Bandow The National InterestCandidate Donald Trump offered a sharp break from his predecessors . He was particularly critical of neoconservatives , who seemed to back war at every turn.Indeed , he promised not to include in his administration those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war . And he s generally kept that commitment , for instance rejecting as deputy secretary of state Elliot Abrams , who said Trump was unfit to be president.Substantively candidate Trump appeared to offer not so much a philosophy as an inclination . Practical if not exactly realist , he cared more for consequences than his three immediate predecessors , who had treated wars as moral crusades in Somalia , the Balkans , Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya and Syria . In contrast , Trump promised : unlike other candidates for the presidency , war and aggression will not be my first instinct . Yet so far the Trump administration is shaping up as a disappointment for those who hoped for a break from the liberal interventionist/neoconservative synthesis.The first problem is staffing . In Washington people are policy . The president can speak and tweet , but he needs others to turn ideas into reality and implement his directives . It doesn t appear that he has any foreign policy realists around him , or anyone with a restrained view of America s international responsibilities.Rex Tillerson , James Mattis and H. R. McMaster are all serious and talented , and none are neocons . But all seem inclined toward traditional foreign policy approaches and committed to moderating their boss s unconventional thoughts .

       " 'TRIPOLI - Across Libya s capital residents have started drilling through pavements to access wells in a desperate search for water after the taps ran dry in a new low for living conditions . After years of neglect , workers turned off the water to do urgent maintenance earlier this month , cutting supplies to many Tripoli households . Then an armed group sabotaged the system , prolonging the misery . The water crisis is a powerful symbol of state failure in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the Middle East but has been gripped by turmoil since a 2011 uprising unseated Muammar Gaddafi . For Libyans the chaos has meant power cuts and crippling cash shortages . These are often made worse by battles between armed groups vying for control of the fractured oil-rich state and its poorly-maintained infrastructure . We haven t had water for ten days . The state does nothing , said Nasser Said , a landlord in Tripoli s upmarket Ben Ashour district . Already equipped with a generator to keep the power running during outages that sometimes last more than a day , he hired drillers to dig some 31 meters to extract groundwater for the six apartments in the residential block he owns . No water , no electricity . You become a state in a state , he said , standing next to his building on a leafy sidestreet . We last had to do this maybe 20 years ago . Like many Libyans , Said is skeptical about the chances of U.N.-led peace talks unifying rival factions that have been fighting for control . The talks were adjourned last week with little sign of progress in creating a government that could stabilize Libya and stand up to armed groups that have repeatedly seized oil facilities and other state assets to make demands . The U.N.-supported Government of National Accord ( GNA ) has struggled to impose its authority since its leaders arrived in Tripoli in March last year . Early last week an armed faction in the south said it had turned off water supplies from Gaddafi s Great Man Made River , a pipeline system that pumps water from underneath Libya s vast southern desert to coastal areas such as Tripoli . The group is seeking the release of a leader imprisoned by a rival faction in the capital , said Tawfiq Shwehaidi , a manager at the Great Man Made River based in the eastern city of Benghazi . We had started maintenance work on the 16th ( of October ) and cut supplies to Tripoli , he said . Afterwards an armed group ... set one power plant on fire which closed three other plants and shut down 24 wells . That has deprived residents of water while boosting the business of drillers who for 4,000-6,000 Libyan dinars ( $ 2,940- $ 4,410 at the official exchange rate ) access groundwater unused in some neighborhoods since the Great Man Made River started pumping water to Tripoli in 1996 . We drill about three wells in two weeks it takes about three to four days to drill a well , said Abdulsalam Forganea , a 23-year-old worker helping to operate an ageing drilling rig . Parts of Tripoli offer a semblance of normality and power cuts have eased since the summer . The city has seen fewer big clashes since a handful of armed groups aligned with the GNA earlier this year . But security is still fragile . A former prime minister was abducted in August for nine days by one of the two most powerful armed groups , while the other engaged in a battle this month that shut down the airport . A reporter recently saw a traffic clogged commercial street suddenly empty as a man was fatally shot by militiamen . Kidnapping for ransom is rife . A conflict that escalated in 2014 has put extra pressure on a Tripoli population that swelled to an estimated three million with the arrival of displaced families from other Libyan cities . Public health services are failing , inflation has spiraled , and the start of the school year has been delayed by several weeks because teachers are striking over salaries . Shutdowns crippled oil revenues so little has been spent on repairs and maintenance , and the water network and other infrastructure have been corroded . Most government spending goes on public salaries , including for former rebel groups that forced their way onto the state payroll after Gaddafi s overthrow . No budget has been transferred ... since 2011 except the emergency budget , which is the result of the financial difficulties experienced by the Libyan state , said Naji Assaed , head of the Libyan Water Authority . Production at desalination plants has fallen sharply , with output at a plant in the western town of Zuwara dropping from 80,000 cubic liters to 16,000 cl annually . Assaed said officials were working hard to resolve the crisis , but it was not clear when supplies would be restored . As he spoke a tanker arrived up to deliver water for his tattered ministry building . In the absence of adequate spare parts , lack of budgets , lack of stability in the security situation , security chaos , people do not comply with the law and all this has affected the performance of the system , he said .

       " '( In March 16 item , corrects timing of legislative session in final paragraph ) By Rich McKay ATLANTA - A religious freedom bill described by opponents as being discriminatory against same-sex couples passed the Georgia state legislature on Wednesday night in an 11th-hour vote ahead of the session ’ s close . The legislation , dubbed the Religious Liberty Bill , still has to be signed by Georgia ’ s Republican Governor Nathan Deal to become law . Deal has made clear that he will not sign a bill that allows discrimination , but his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday night . Similar bills in states like Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year , forcing many lawmakers to retreat from the provisions . The Georgia bill , reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far , declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding . The bill also grants faith-based organizations – churches , religious schools or associations - the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object . Faith-based groups also could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organization ’ s . Opponents say the bill could be used to deny services and discriminate against same-sex couples . “ The decision by the legislature today was to make an egregious and discriminatory bill even worse , ” the Human Rights Campaign , which represents the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender community , said in a statement . “ It ’ s appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia , ” it said . Mike Griffin , a lobbyist and spokesman for the Georgia Baptist Convention , applauded the bill ’ s passage . He said that while the bill did not give them everything they wanted , he added : “ We feel we ’ ve advanced our protection of our First Amendment Right to religious freedom. ” “ Our rights of religious liberty don ’ t end inside the four walls of a church , ” he said . In a late added amendment , the proposed law says that it can not allow discrimination already prohibited by federal law , which opponents said could nullify some of its provisions . More than 300 large corporations and small businesses , including Delta Airlines and Coca Cola , have signed a pledge decrying the Georgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it . The state legislature is set to wrap up its current legislative session next week .',\n",

       " \"Jeffrey Cohen was a man who believed The meaning of life is OOPS ! ' according to his obituary .

Even Weird Al Yankovich stopped by to see him.He is described as compassionate and kind someone who would always put others before himself , happily and without hesitation . His love of dirty and groan-inducing jokes was legendary . He also has one final request of those who love him and all who read his obituary don t f * ck up the next election , or at least do some good in the world : Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers , please do not vote for Donald Trump . ( Also acceptable donations to the Nimmo Educational Foundation www.nimmoed.org or a charity of your choice . ) That s right to honor his memory , Cohen asks one simple thing : Don t vote for Trump . Don t throw away our future.His obituary does not indicate whom he would choose as president , but he doesn t want people to vote for someone who would ban Muslims from entering the United States , throw them into concentration camps ( after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special badges , of course ) , or any of the multitude of horrific ideas the brain-gerbils that reside beneath his hairpiece suggest . Cohen doesn t want a big beautiful wall running the length of our ( southern ) border , nor does he want someone who would allow Sarah Palin to speak.This request is the opposite of an obituary request that popped up earlier this month when a Virginia man asked , in lieu of flowers please vote for Donald Trump . The billionaire tweeted the obituary , declaring thanking the deceased man and declaring him to be a great person . It seems as though Cohen made this request as a light-hearted retort to the Trump fan s suggestion that Americans vote for someone who would later be endorsed by Sarah Palin.Thank you so much . Earnest must have been a great person . https : //t.co/2DZp7YOadj pic.twitter.com/2YtLlEwceB Donald J.

       " 'The New York Observer , which Ivanka Trump s husband , Jared Kushner , owns , has made its presidential endorsement . Or , more accurately , its presidential non-endorsement . After endorsing Trump during the primaries , his own son-in-law s paper has decided it s not endorsing anyone at all.The Observer s editor-in-chief , Ken Kurson , simply said : Observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general . Oh , ouch . That just hurts , at least for Trump . We re ecstatic . The Observer can t endorse Hillary or they d probably all get fired , and the same thing could happen if they endorsed a third-party candidate . But it seems that they can t , in good conscience , endorse their owner s father-in-law.Wow.Trump hasn t been able to get very many newspaper endorsements in the general in fact , he s only gotten six endorsements in all , and they re all from small papers with the exception of Sheldon Adelson s Las Vegas Review-Journal . That s it . That s all . Hundreds of newspapers in the country , and Trump garners a whole six endorsements.Compare that to Hillary s dozens of newspaper endorsements , which include conservative papers like the Arizona Republic , which had never endorsed a Democratic candidate in its 126-year history , and the Dallas Morning News , which hadn t endorsed a Democrat for more than 75 years . Other papers with strong histories of endorsing Republicans likewise broke with tradition to endorse Hillary.You know your candidate just sucks horrifically when his own son-in-law s paper can t bring itself to endorse him . Amusingly , the Observer has actually had issues with its coverage of Trump because of Kushner s relationship , with Kurson saying in 2015 : If we run something pro-Trump we will automatically be accused of carrying water for him ( on account of the relationship to our publisher ) . If we run something anti-Trump , we will be accused of trying to curry favor with our peers in journalism or worse , intentionally being only a little hard on him so that later we can love him up and point to the earlier softball as proof that we re fair . So they re in an impossible position , really , but their refusal to endorse Trump at all is a blow to his standing as a candidate.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images',\n",

The European Commission , the EU s executive , has repeatedly rebuked Bulgaria for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials and for not overhauling a creaking judiciary . This law corresponds to the wishes of Bulgarian citizens and the European Commission , said Tsvetan Tsvetanov , chairman of the ruling GERB party s parliamentary group . Analysts voiced concern , though , that the bill would not allow efficient investigations of corruption networks . The management of a special anti-graft unit envisaged by the legislation would be appointed by parliament , something analysts said could limit its objectivity . Radev said the new five-person unit , meant to investigate persons occupying high state posts as well as assets and conflict of interest , may not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents . The instruments envisaged in this law are ineffective , Radev said last week . It does not deal a blow on those who feed corruption , and it can be used as a weapon against inconvenient people . He said he would veto the measure . The president , prime minister and lawmakers could be targets of investigation , as well as municipal councillors , directors of hospitals and border customs bosses . The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies , just before Bulgaria assumes the six-month , rotating EU presidency in January . Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989 , and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel .',\n",

       " 'MUMBAI - A rush hour stampede killed at least 22 people and wounded 36 on Friday during a sudden monsoon downpour at a busy railway station in India s commercial hub of Mumbai , government and emergency officials said . India has the world s fourth biggest rail network , but it is grappling with underinvestment and overcrowding , especially in the city of 20 million where rail accidents have killed more than 3,000 people in each of the last three years . The cause of the stampede on a tiny bridge at the central Elphinstone Road station was being investigated , a police official at the accident site said . Some of the injured are in serious condition , Deepak Sawant , the health minister of the western state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital , said at a hospital where the injured were taken . The stampede , at a station recently renamed Prabhadevi , took place after the cloudburst caught commuters off guard , sending scores scurrying for cover under a pedestrian overbridge , said Akash Koteja , one of those injured . Trains were rolling in and some people wanted to get out of the station , but others were not making way . When a few tried , it led to a stampede , Koteja added . The bridge is usually crowded at that time of day , as it also provides an exit route for passengers disembarking at an adjoining railway station , he added . Manish Mishra , a witness who helped some of the injured , said the situation was worsened as officials did not respond immediately , or take steps to control the crowd . Emergency officials responded rapidly , state officials said , however . Immediately after the incident , rail , police and hospital authorities rushed to provide treatment to those injured , state minister Vinod Tawde told reporters . Railways Minister Piyush Goyal , who was on a visit to Mumbai , has ordered an enquiry into the incident led by a top railway safety official , he said on social network Twitter . Over the last two months , Mumbai has reeled from devastation caused by heavy seasonal monsoon rains . Last month a deluge killed 14 people , wrecked homes and caused chaos . Torrential rain was also blamed for the collapse of a 117-year-old building that killed 34 people , and water-logging last week that disrupted flights after a passenger jet overshot a runway . Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley sent Twitter condolence messages to stampede victims families . Hundreds of social media users angered by the event questioned the government s priorities , targeting Modi s ambitious $ 17-billion plan for a bullet train to link Mumbai with Ahmedabad in neighboring Gujarat state . Many tweets urged the government to fund basic rail upgrades instead .',\n",
       " 'Jill Stein , Green Party candidate for President of the United States , has made her case this election by painting herself as being the anti-Hillary Clinton . She claims that Clinton s ties to Wall Street and her more cozy feelings towards big corporations and polluters make her a faux-progressive . So Stein claims that she is the true outsider progressive who has the people s best interest at heart and that she will end the too-big-to-fail mentality on Wall Street.But her investment portfolio shows something completely different.Uncovered by the Daily Beast , Stein has millions of dollars worth of investments in the very entities she rails against in her faltering presidential campaign : According to the financial-disclosure form she filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on March 30 , 2016 , Stein and her husband , Richard Rohrer , have investments ( with the exception of real estate ) valued at anywhere from $ 3,832,050 to $ 8,505,000 . ( Stein told The Daily Beast she inherited over a half-million dollars from her parents . ) We don t know their exact net worth because filers are only required to provide a range of the value of their investments as opposed to exact values.Those investments , which but Stein s net worth in the millions ( what an outsider ) , are held in mutual funds or index funds which provide more consistent , safer returns than individually picked stocks.Stein is invested in : Stein also has $ 50,001- $ 100,000 invested in a fund that represents Raytheon , which is the fourth largest defense contractor in the world and relies heavily on military contracts.So all of these entities , in which opposition to has been the cornerstone of Stein s campaign , are also her biggest benefactors financially.For years Jill Stein has made it her mission to paint Hillary Clinton and other Democrats as backstabbing , two-faced , corrupt shills while glorifying herself as a goddess in the progressive movement . Meanwhile , she s been padding her net worth thanks to big oil , big pharma , Wall Street and defense contractors.Of course the Stein campaign refused to take any shred of responsibility , telling the Daily Beast : Like many Americans who hold retirement accounts , pension funds , or who invest in the American economy , my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which I have no control in management or decision-making . Sadly , most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy degraded as it is by the fossil-fuel , defense and finance industries.She also left out the part where she could , if she really was the principled candidate she says she is , forgo these investments and invest the money somewhere else : While it s true that Stein would not have control over the investments of the funds she invested in , she did have a choice of whether to invest in these funds to begin with . In the past , political candidates , in an effort to avoid a conflict of interest or have their judgment called into question , have invested their entire portfolios in U.S. Treasuries , cash/cash equivalents , in socially responsible index funds , or clean-energy funds . In her statement , Stein said that she has explored more socially responsible funds but found their investments in fracking and large-scale biofuels not much better than the non-green funds . I have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people , planet , and peace . But apparently big pharma , oil and Wall Street investments do ?

       " 'SARANDE , Albania - Whatever the outcome of November ’ s U.S. presidential election , the Albanian town of Sarande is backing Hillary Clinton by erecting a bronze bust to thank her for supporting Albanian causes . Albania is a staunch ally of the United States and has a history of commemorating its presidents . Woodrow Wilson has a statue there for helping foster the young Albanian state . So does George W. Bush , who visited Albania in 2007 and backed the independence of Kosovo , whose population is mainly ethnic Albanian . Bill Clinton has a statue in Kosovo in recognition of his role in the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 in support of Kosovo . “ This bust in our most central public space is an expression of our gratitude through Mrs. Clinton to the American people and state for what they have done for the Albanian people and nation , ” Sarande Mayor Florjana Koka told a small crowd . It was also a tribute to Clinton , the Democratic presidential candidate , as an example to women in politics , said Koka , the first female mayor of Sarande . American tourist Jessica Rightmayer wiped away tears as the U.S. national anthem was played . “ I think it is beautiful and I really think it is a very good likeness , ” she said . Sculptor Idriz Balani said the idea for the statue came to him when Hillary Clinton told the Albanian parliament in 2012 that Albania and the United States had together marked the Balkan country ’ s first centenary and would be friends for another 100 years . Her “ charm , elegance and vitality ” had convinced him to sculpt her . “ I used three photos to get her smile , hair , posture and attire right and kept the necklace . She exudes benevolence . I hope they like it , ” Balani told Reuters .',\n",
       " 'Well , what would Friday be without the latest document dump from the Clinton email investigation ? Yesterday afternoon , with the public in distracted anticipation of the coming weekend and Monday s Clinton-Trump debate showdown , the FBI released another 189 pages of interview reports.Along with this document dump comes remarkable news : According to House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz , the limited immunity was granted in order to persuade Ms. Mills to surrender her laptop computer so the FBI could check whether classified information was stored on it.This is very strange . There was no need to grant concessions to Mills . The Justice Department could have required the production of the computer by simply issuing a grand jury subpoena . And had there been any concern that Mills would not cooperate , would destroy the computer , or would misplace it ( as Team Clinton claims to have misplaced so many Hillary devices ) , investigators could have applied for a search warrant and seized the computer.In normal cases , the Justice Department does not grant immunity in exchange for evidence when it has lawful power to compel production of that evidence.In a normal case , immunity-from-prosecution never enters into this equation . Immunity is a valuable concession that the Justice Department is only supposed to grant if there is no other way to get the evidence in question . Investigators are not supposed to pay for evidence the law empowers them to obtain cost-free . If , for example , a prosecutor surmised that a suspect s hair might match hair recovered at the scene of a robbery , the prosecutor would not offer the suspect immunity from prosecution for the robbery in exchange for the suspect s provision of a hair sample . The prosecutor would issue a subpoena requiring the suspect to provide the grand jury with a hair sample ; if there was a match , the grand jury would then indict the suspect for the robbery . As the Associated Press puts it : By including the emails recovered from the laptops in the immunity agreements , the Justice Department exempted key physical evidence from any potential criminal case against [ Hillary Clinton s ] aides . It makes no sense to have done this unless the Justice Department had already decided it would not prosecute Mills and Samuelson , no matter what the proof showed.Read more : National Review',\n",
       " 'ROME - Mamadu Bassir sits eating a breakfast of warm milk and cookies in a migrants shelter in Rome - one of nearly 65,000 lone youngsters who have survived the perilous sea journey from North Africa to Italy in the past four years . His meal finished , the gangly 17-year-old tells the story of his trip from Guinea , via a Libyan prison where a guard knocked out three of his teeth with a club , to his crossing of the Mediterranean , where he watched a friend drown in front of him . Both fell into the water as migrants scrabbled out of their deflating rubber boat to reach rescuers . Bassir could not swim but someone threw him a life-jacket just in time . I fell in the sea , but Italians saved me , he says . Then he puts his head on the table and starts to cry . For many of his fellow young migrants , the dangers do not stop when they reach dry land . Four months ago , Italy passed a law aimed at protecting child immigrants , even those who do not qualify as refugees , providing them with housing , food , healthcare and an education . But without adult guidance and under pressure to send money home , campaigners say thousands end up back in the hands of smugglers or exploited to work long hours for little pay . Many want to reach relatives in other European countries , but increased border security in France , Switzerland and Austria often means they have to pay high fees to be smuggled north . They ( the minors ) are the most vulnerable elements of this big phenomenon called migration , said Kostas Moschochoritis , head of humanitarian group Intersos , which operates the shelter for unaccompanied minors in Rome where Bassir , who has nowhere to go , has been sleeping . It has hosted 4,000 unaccompanied minors since 2011 , and just opened a new shelter with more beds on the outskirts of the capital . More than 5,000 minors have left the communities where they had been living this year , said Raffaela Milano , a director at Save the Children in Italy . Of these , it s inevitable that some are exploited . We have the stereotype in Europe that they are adults because they have been through so much . It s not true . They are still kids , Milano said . Syed Hasnain , a 28-year-old Afghan , arrived in Italy a decade ago . His mother sent him away when he was 10 years old to keep the Taliban from taking him to fight . Now he helps youngsters like Bassir . The fundamental thing that they want to do when they arrive in Italy is to get a job , Hasnain said . Italians can not give him jobs because the teenagers , mostly boys , do not yet speak Italian , so he goes to the people from his country ... they know that he needs money because his family puts pressure on him to send money home , Hasnain said . The majority of them , they say , I miss my family , my country , my culture , my society , but the main thing that I miss is my mum , he said . For now , Bassir is making his way with the help of charities like Intersos . He is taking Italian classes , and has an immigration lawyer helping get the documents he needs to either work legally or to go to school . He longs to see his mother in Guinea , but is determined to stay where he is . If I stay in Europe , I ll have more of a future , he says .',\n",

       " 'MOSCOW - The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed allegations Russia had hacked Democratic Party emails as “ horror stories ” dreamt up by U.S. politicians , saying it never interfered in other countries ’ election campaigns . “ Moscow is at pains to avoid any words that could be interpreted as direct or indirect interference in the election process , ” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters . “ ... We see that the Russian card is in the red corner on the writing table of all Washington politicians during the election campaign , and that very often they make it a trump card in their game. ” Peskov was responding after U.S. President Barack Obama in an interview with NBC News said it was possible Russia would try to influence the U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have blamed on Russian hackers . “ This reminds me of a company where they tell each other horror stories and then start being frightened of their own stories , ” said Peskov .

       " 'The Los Angeles County School Board has caused an uproar with their right-wing residents because they do not want federal immigration officers inside of schools . The board voted unanimously on Tuesday to direct staff members at any school not to allow ICE agents inside of schools or provide federal authorities with student data without clearance . This move has prompted anti-immigration conservatives to lash out because , apparently , they believe children should be hauled out of their classrooms and arrested.Here are some of the comments under the article on the LA Times Facebook page : And the comments under the article on the site were not much better : Well , aren t they just chock full of family values ? ! What s even funnier is that these imbeciles obviously have not ever bothered to look into our countries immigration policies because if they had , this isn t new . Traditionally immigration officials have not raided places they have deemed sensitive like churches and schools . In 2011 , they made this very clear in a memo that stated : This memorandum sets forth Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) policy regarding certain enforcement actions by ICE officers and agents at or focused on sensitive locations . This policy is designed to ensure that these enforcement actions do not occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as schools and churches The only reason the school board voted on this was to reassure parents , who do not trust the government , that school was safe for their kids . Ever since nationwide immigration sweeps netted more than a hundred undocumented people last month , parents have been even more frightened . According to the LA Times : Although there were no raids in L.A. last month , residents are concerned because the city has a large Central American immigrant population.So to Rodriguez , the resolution is , in part , a symbolic gesture to tell families that we stand for the safety of our children , he said . These are safe spaces . It s sad that the right-wing is so full of hate , that they want kids to be afraid to go to school . And if these kids overcome their fear , they want law enforcement agents with guns to rip these children away from their families because they had the audacity to try to receive an education .

       " 'BAGHDAD - Iraq s prime minister insisted on Thursday that the Kurdish independence referendum be declared void , an apparent rejection of the Kurdistan region s offer to freeze its independence push as part of efforts to resolve the crisis through talks . We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the Constitution , Haider al-Abadi said in a statement . The Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire , a suspension of the referendum result and starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution . Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal . It responded last week by seizing back the city of Kirkuk , the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the Kurds had captured from militant group Islamic State . Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq s border crossings with Turkey , at Fish-Khabur , located inside the Kurdish autonomous region . Fish-Khabur is strategically vital because oil from both Kurdish and government-held parts of northern Iraq crosses via a pipeline there into Turkey , the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any Kurdish independence bid . The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides , arming and training both the Kurds and the central government s army to fight Islamic State .',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW - Russia and the United States agreed to set up a working group to try to mend their battered ties on Wednesday after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held lengthy talks in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin and the Russian foreign minister . It was not clear until the last minute whether Putin would grant Tillerson an audience , but the fact that he did is likely to be seen as a sign that Moscow has not given up on the new U.S. administration and wants to try to improve ties which both sides agree are languishing at a post Cold War low . A joint news conference between Sergei Lavrov , the Russian foreign minister , and Tillerson showed how much work there is to do though as the Russian used many of his speaking opportunities to lambast Washington over its actions in Syria and what he said was its unhelpful foreign interference in the past . Tillerson , on his first visit to Russia in his current role , struck a more conciliatory stance , but said ties and trust levels were at a low point and restated Washington ’ s position that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must eventually relinquish power , a position starkly at odds with Russia . “ There is a low level of trust between our two countries , ” Tillerson said . “ The world ’ s two foremost nuclear powers can not have this kind of relationship. ” Lavrov said that while Russia was not placing its hopes in Assad or any other individual in Syria , toppling the Syrian government was not an option and that a political process had to be allowed to play out . “ We discussed Assad today , ” said Lavrov . “ I don ’ t remember any positive examples of how a dictator was overthrown and everything was just fine afterwards. ” Differences over a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base last week also bubbled to the surface . Washington says it acted to punish the Syrian government for what it said was a devastating nerve gas attack Damascus launched against its own people that killed scores . Russia said the U.S. strike was illegal though and Lavrov repeated Moscow ’ s stance on Wednesday , saying an international investigation should be left to determine who was to blame and what happened . It was wrong to blame Assad without knowing the facts , he said . Tillerson said the United States was confident that Assad ’ s forces were behind the gas attack , but said there was “ no firm information ” to indicate Russian forces were involved in the same attack . In a move that slightly softened the atmosphere , Lavrov said Putin had agreed to restore a U.S.-Russia air safety agreement covering Syria which Moscow suspended in retaliation for the U.S. missile strikes . The agreement would be reactivated with immediate effect , Viktor Ozerov , the head of the Russian upper house of parliament ’ s defense committee told the RIA news agency .',\n",

Nunes has insisted from the beginning of the House s Russia investigation that the real problem is who s leaking information , and why he could identify some of the people in the intelligence reports , and not the possibility of high treason.But now that we know he lied about where his sources came from , we have to wonder where his loyalties lie and whether he himself is guilty of treason.While the House Intelligence Committee remains stalled due to Nunes feeling more obligated to Trump than he does to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation , the Senate Intelligence Committee is plugging smoothly on with theirs .

       " 'BARCELONA/MADRID - Catalan secessionists were working on Friday toward a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain that could be adopted next week in defiance of a court order and increased economic pressure from Madrid . After Spain s Constitutional Court suspended a session of the Catalan regional parliament set for Monday , which had been expected to endorse an independence declaration , the parliament said the region s pro-independence leader Carles Puigdemont would address the assembly at 6 p.m. ( 1600 GMT ) on Tuesday . Madrid apologized for the first time on Friday for police use of violence in trying to hinder a weekend referendum it had declared illegal . That crackdown raised the temperature of a confrontation that has grown into the worst political crisis for decades in Spain . A Catalan legislator was quoted by El Mundo newspaper as saying secessionist parties in the Catalan parliament were discussing an independence declaration to be submitted to the assembly next Tuesday . We are in talks about a text , with paper and pencil , on the declaration that we want the regional parliament to accept on Tuesday , Carles Riera , a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP ( Popular Unity Candidacy ) , was quoted as saying . Nobody has put forward any scenario of delay , ambiguity or confusion . We are not working on that scenario , he said . The stakes are high for the euro zone s fourth-largest economy . Catalonia is the source of a huge chunk of its tax revenue and hosts multinationals from carmaker Volkswagen to drugs firm AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) . The Catalan region s head of foreign affairs , Raul Romeva , told the BBC earlier that the Catalan parliament intended to make a decision on independence , without specifying when . Parliament will discuss , parliament will meet . It will be a debate and this is important , Romeva said . The Spanish government stepped up economic pressure on the Catalan government on Friday by passing a law to make it easier for companies to move their operations around the country , potentially dealing a blow to the region s finances . Within hours of the government s move , CaixaBank ( CABK.MC ) , Spain s third biggest lender and Catalonia s biggest company , said its board had decided to move its registered office to Valencia in light of the current political and social situation in Catalonia . Catalonia-based utility Gas Natural ( GAS.MC ) said its board had decided to move its registered office to Madrid for as long as the legal uncertainty in Catalonia continued . They joined a number of other Catalonia-based companies , including Sabadell ( SABE.MC ) , Spain s fifth-largest lender , that have already announced plans this week to move their registered offices elsewhere in Spain . Spain made a conciliatory gesture in apologizing for Sunday s referendum violence , where Spanish police used batons and rubber bullets to stop people voting . The scenes brought worldwide condemnation and fanned separatist feeling but failed to prevent what the Catalan government described as an overwhelming yes vote . When I see these images , and more so when I know people have been hit , pushed and even one person who was hospitalized , I can t help but regret it and apologize on behalf of the officers that intervened , Enric Millo , the Spanish government s representative in Catalonia , said in a television interview . The apology came after the Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia quoted sources in Puigdemont s party as saying a unilateral declaration of independence could be delayed if Madrid made a gesture , such as withdrawing some Spanish police reinforcements from the region . Artur Mas , a former head of the Catalan government who was barred from public office for two years in March for staging an informal independence referendum in 2014 , told the Financial Times on Friday that the region had yet to lay the groundwork for real independence . He said there was a debate among Catalan leaders about whether now was the right time to unilaterally declare independence . Amid calls from many groups , including Barcelona soccer club , for a mediated solution to the standoff , Swiss state broadcaster RTS said neutral Switzerland was ready to help forge dialogue between the Spanish government and Catalonia . The foreign ministry said Switzerland was in touch with Spain and Catalonia but conditions for talks were not yet ripe . Puigdemont has called for international mediation to find a way out of the impasse . Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has offered all-party political talks to find a solution , opening the door to a deal giving Catalonia more autonomy , but only if the Catalan government gives up any independence ambitions . You can t hold talks if people are outside the law , Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting . Final referendum results released by the Catalan regional government on Friday showed 90.18 percent support for breaking away among the nearly 2.3 million people who voted . But turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot . Secession could fuel separatist-nationalist divisions across the rest of Spain , which only this year saw ETA guerrillas in the northern Basque region lay down their arms after a campaign lasting almost half a century . Spanish ruling-party lawmakers say Rajoy is considering invoking the constitution to dissolve the regional parliament and force fresh Catalan elections if the region s government goes ahead with an independence declaration . Romeva s remarks about the Catalan parliament pressing ahead with an independence debate hit Spanish stocks and bonds , including shares in the region s two largest banks , Caixabank and Sabadell . In a separate development that could raise tensions , Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero appeared in Spain s High Court on Friday to answer accusations he committed sedition by failing to enforce a court ban on holding the referendum . Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggest a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia back independence .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday said lawmakers are examining whether there is any action they can take over Hillary Clinton ’ s email practices while secretary of state , saying it appeared she had received preferential treatment from the FBI . Ryan , a Republican , said the House of Representatives would not “ foreclose any options ” when asked whether a special prosecutor was necessary to get to the bottom of the Democratic presidential candidate ’ s use of a private email server while she ran the State Department . The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it would not recommend charges regarding Clinton ’ s email , although FBI Director James Comey rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for “ extremely careless ” handling of classified information . The FBI decision , Ryan said , “ looks like ” preferential treatment for Clinton . Ryan , who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012 , said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper should deny Clinton access to classified information during the campaign , although presidential candidates normally get such access once they are formally nominated . Clinton ’ s campaign , responding to Ryan ’ s remarks , said House Republicans appeared to be trying to launch another “ sham of an inquiry ” against Clinton now that they had ended their two-year probe of the deaths of four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi while Clinton was secretary of state . “ For weeks Republicans have said they trusted FBI Director Comey to lead an independent review into Secretary Clinton ’ s emails , but now they are second-guessing his judgment because his findings do not align with their conspiracy theories , ” campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in an emailed statement . The campaign said on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI ’ s decision , noting that the candidate has said repeatedly that it was a mistake to use her personal email while secretary of state . Ryan noted that two House committees are looking into the Clinton email matter — the Judiciary committee and the Oversight Committee , where Comey has been invited to testify on Thursday . “ He ( Comey ) did say that short of prosecution , some kind of administrative action might be in order , ” Ryan said , adding : “ I think it ’ s the least we can do , given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers. ” “ So look , I think that ’ s something that the administration should do on its own , but we ’ ll look into seeing if that ’ s something we can do as well , ” Ryan said . Senate Republican leaders said they thought Clinton ’ s testimony to the FBI should be released to the public .

       " 'WASHINGTON/GRAND JUNCTION , Colo. - U.S. President Barack Obama lacerated Donald Trump on Tuesday over his repeated assertions that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him , telling the Republican presidential candidate to “ stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. ” With opinion polls showing him falling further back against his White House rival , Democrat Hillary Clinton , Trump has intensified his allegations , although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is rare . At a campaign rally in Grand Junction , Colorado , Trump continued his attack , saying , “ The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters. ” But he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president : a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of Congress , six years for members of the House of Representatives , 12 years for members of the Senate . Obama was asked about Trump ’ s voter fraud assertions on Tuesday at a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden following meetings with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi . He responded with a blistering attack on the Republican candidate , noting that U.S. elections are run and monitored by local officials , who may well be appointed by Republican governors of states , and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in American elections . Obama said there was “ no serious ” person who would suggest it was possible to rig American elections , adding , “ I ’ d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. ” Trump , speaking at the Grand Junction rally Tuesday evening , said that Obama should stop campaigning for “ Crooked Hillary ” and “ get out and work on jobs and work on the border. ” Trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the November election result , citing scant or questionable evidence , including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people , and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on Election Day . He has sharpened his allegations even as Republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded . In a report titled “ The Truth About Voter Fraud , ” the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent . An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014 . Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates . In pointed remarks that were part civics lesson , Obama said that if Trump wins on Nov. 8 , “ It would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech ” and “ it would be my job ... and escort him over to the Capitol , in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power ” at his swearing in . Trump ’ s vice presidential running mate , Mike Pence , took a softer tone than Trump during a campaign appearance in North Carolina , saying he was “ confident ” that the integrity of the election will be ensured . But Pence added that “ in recent years we ’ ve had instances , proven instances of voter fraud. ” A number of Republican-led states , citing the need to prevent voter fraud , have passed laws with stricter identification requirements . But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting . Trump trails Clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls , according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics . Over the last few weeks , Trump , who has never previously run for office , has been embroiled in one controversy after another , eclipsing policy issues such as taxes , trade , the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns . With three weeks left until Election Day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states , Trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances . He has said the remarks were just “ locker room ” talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say Trump groped or touched them inappropriately , denouncing his accusers as liars and fame-seekers . The controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates , to be held on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas . Trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate . He appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate , but according to polling , more voters saw Clinton as the victor . Wednesday ’ s debate , like the first one , will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions . Topics chosen by moderator Chris Wallace include debt and entitlements , immigration , the economy , the Supreme Court , foreign hot spots , and fitness to be president . At Tuesday ’ s press conference , Obama also criticized Trump for his “ continued flattery ” of Russian President Vladimir Putin , saying “ it is out of step with ” the country . Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and on Monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the Russian leader before he is even sworn in as president .',\n",
       " 'LONDON - Thousands of children and teenagers , including large numbers of girls , were referred to Britain s often-criticized counter-terrorism program Prevent , new official figures showed on Thursday . Prevent is a key strand of Britain s security strategy which was launched in 2003 to combat extremism after the Sept 11 attacks on the United States . It has grown in prominence since the 2005 suicide attack on London s transport network which killed 52 people and the rise of the Islamic State in recent years . It has been dogged since its inception by claims that it is used to spy on Muslim communities and a 2015 government edict instructing public bodies such as schools , health workers and universities to report concerns further exacerbated those fears . The first official Prevent figures from Britain s Home Office ( interior ministry ) showed that of the 7,631 individuals thought to be at risk of being drawn into terrorism from April 2015 to March 2016 , almost a third were children . Of all those referred , only five percent , the 381 assessed to be the most at risk , were eventually deemed to need support from specialist mentors in the voluntary , de-radicalization scheme known as Channel . Some 63 individuals withdrew from the process and the Home Office said there was no data about whether they or any others who had been referred to Prevent or gone through the Channel process had later gone on to be involved in extremism . Two-thirds of Prevent referrals were made over fears of Islamist extremism and 10 percent because of far-right concerns . The vast bulk came from the education sector and police , with 2,127 aged under 15 , including 532 girls , and 2,147 aged 15 to 20 , with 420 female . A senior Home Office official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , cited the case of a nine-year-old boy who had been referred to Prevent after he stood up in class and said he supported Islamic State . The boy , who had been bullied at school , had been watching IS execution videos after searching for news coverage after the Paris attacks . After a year of support , his life was turned around , the official said . In the last two years the number of teenagers has spiked and the number of teenagers that I ve had who are on the autistic spectrum has also spiked , one of Channel s Islamist mentors , told reporters . What IS and these groups have understood is young people need narratives and they ve created narratives which make a very complex world seem very simple . Britain suffered four militant attacks this year that killed 36 people - the deadliest spate since the London 7/7 bombings of 2005 . Britain s Home Secretary has been meeting representatives of leading U.S. tech firms Facebook , Google , Microsoft and Twitter in Washington this week as part of her ongoing effort for them to do more to tackle online extremism . A Prevent coordinator said the proliferation of extremist online content was an accelerant rather than a cause . It s the petrol going on the fire , but it s not the tinder which sparks the flame in the first place , he said .',\n",

       " 'HONOLULU - President Barack Obama on Thursday authorized a series of sanctions against Russia for intervening in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and warned of more action to come . “ These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government , and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior , ” Obama said in a statement . “ These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia ’ s aggressive activities . We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing , some of which will not be publicized , ” he said .

       " 'WASHINGTON - A Democratic lawmaker will introduce a bill on Thursday that seeks to broaden the powers of a U.S. government panel that reviews mergers for national security concerns , including giving it the ability to block a deal if it could cause job losses , but it faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House . According to a draft copy of the proposed legislation reviewed by Reuters , the multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) would be able to review a deal “ to determine whether such transaction is of net benefit to the United States. ” If the legislation passed , CFIUS would consider a proposed deal ’ s effect on employment , product innovation , and public health and safety , as well as national security , according to the draft reviewed by Reuters . It would also consider factors like whether a foreign company purchasing a U.S. company abides by U.S. rules concerning disclosure and transparency . But it is unclear whether the measure , which will be introduced by Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro , has support from other lawmakers in the House . A spokesman for Republicans in the House Committee on Financial Services , which considered an earlier version of the bill in 2014 , did not immediately respond to a request for comment . Even if the DeLauro bill passed the House , there would need to be companion legislation passed in the Senate and then it would still need to get signed into law by President Barack Obama . There is currently no companion bill in the Senate , according to a source on Capitol Hill . DeLauro introduced her previous bill following the U.S. approval of China-based Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd ’ s $ 4.7 billion acquisition of pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc , but it never went to the full House for a vote . While the House bill does not target China specifically , it could have most implications for the country . In 2014 , the last year for which data is available , CFIUS looked at more deals involving China than any other country for the third year in a row . It comes amid signs of increased concerns in Washington about a flurry of proposed takeovers of American companies by Chinese entities . Still , such sweeping legislation could be a tall order for the administration at a time of already tense Sino-U.S. relations . Earlier this month , 46 U.S. lawmakers , most of them Republicans , urged CFIUS to take a hard look at a bid by a Chinese company , Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group , to buy the storied Chicago Stock Exchange because of fears that the deal would give China access to the data of U.S. companies who use the exchange . In the past few weeks alone , CFIUS concerns have killed three proposed Chinese investments . On Tuesday , Western Digital Corp ( WDC.O ) said China ’ s Unisplendour Corp Ltd ( 000938.SZ ) backed out of buying a stake in the U.S. company because CFIUS planned to probe it .',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump practically does something to criticize the media as being fake news on an almost daily basis , but two major news networks have just turned the tables and put him on blast in a major way.The White House is currently up in arms over a recent decision by CNN and MSNBC , who decided not to air Trump s insanely dishonest North Dakota speech from earlier today . Trump was supposed to address tax reform in his speech , but there was a major problem with what he was saying not a word of it was true . In response to this fact-free speech , CNN and MSNBC decided that it was irresponsible to air the speech and decided to spare Americans the misinformation and nonsense.Once the Trump administration found out about this move by the press , the White House practically threw a hissy fit . Special Assistant to the President and Assistant White House Communications Director Steven Chueng tweeted : Instead of insulting their viewers with Trump s lies , MSNBC s Nicole Wallace reported on important , truthful topics such as DACA and Russia . CNN s Jake Tapper focused on Hurricane Irma , Russia , and the debt ceiling while Trump spewed his usual nonsense.This was a major f * ck you to the Trump administration and sends a strong message that the dishonest narrative that his administration continues to put out to the American people will not be tolerated . While people aren t likely going to react so strongly to a topic as dry as tax reform , having two major networks refusing to air his speech is a big deal . Trump desperately wants and needs that coverage , and is obviously pissed that all eyes were not on him . If more cable news networks break from Trump , his already failing presidency will be in even more danger.Featured image is a screenshot',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission ’ s chairman said Tuesday the agency does not have authority to revoke broadcast licenses , despite suggestions from President Donald Trump . Ajit Pai , a Republican who was named chairman of the telecommunications regulator in January , broke days of silence by rejecting Trump ’ s tweet that the FCC could challenge the license of NBC after stories Trump declared were not true . “ Under the law , the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content , ” Pai said at a forum . “ The FCC under my leadership will stand for the First Amendment. ” The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press . Democrats had been pushing Pai to denounce Trump ’ s suggestion that broadcast licenses could be threatened following reports by NBC News that his secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , had called him a “ moron ” after a discussion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal . “ With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks , at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License ? Bad for country ! ” Trump tweeted on Wednesday . Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term “ fake news ” to cast doubt on media reports critical of his administration , often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue . Any move to challenge media companies ’ licenses , however , would likely face significant hurdles . The FCC , an independent federal agency , does not license broadcast networks , but issues them to individual broadcast stations that are renewed on a staggered basis for eight-year periods . Comcast Corp , which owns NBC Universal , also owns 11 broadcast stations , including outlets in New York , Washington , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Boston , Dallas and Chicago . When reviewing licenses the FCC must determine if a renewal is in the public interest . Courts have held that a station exercising its First Amendment rights is not adequate grounds to challenge a license . The agency does not issue similar licenses for cable networks such as CNN and MSNBC , or regulate internet news or other websites . In the early 1970s , then-President Richard Nixon and his top aides discussed using the FCC ’ s license renewal process as a way of punishing The Washington Post for its coverage of the Watergate burglary that ultimately brought down his presidency .',\n",

The ads purchased by Keep The Promise and its various offshoots include radio , television and online and are the latest effort by supporters of Cruz , a U.S. senator of Texas , to dislodge Donald Trump from the front-runner position in Tuesday ’ s critical 11-state Republican nominating contests . Should Trump sweep the contests , it could make stopping his path to the Republican nomination impossible . The outside groups supporting the presidential candidates have already spent more than $ 5.5 million on advertising in Super Tuesday states , according to analysis by of the spending reports filed with Federal Election Commission as of Friday morning . Super PACs are permitted to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals and corporations , but are prohibited from coordinating with the campaigns they are supporting . Most of the Super PACs have been used to fund expensive advertising budgets , while the campaigns themselves are responsible for staff and ground organization . Cruz ’ s backers are hopeful the ads will pull him ahead of Trump . Cruz is locked in a tight battle in his home state of Texas , where 155 delegates to be sent to the Republican National Convention are at stake , out of almost 600 delegates total in the states voting on Super Tuesday . “ On Super Tuesday , voters can both send a message to Washington AND send a serious , proven conservative to the White House by voting for Cruz , ” said Kellyanne Conway , president of Keep the Promise I , one of the groups backing Cruz . The groups spent $ 393,500 on radio ads in seven states . They also purchased more than $ 990,0000 in television ads that will run in Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , Arkansas and Oklahoma - the most crucial states for Cruz to narrow the margins with Trump .

       " 'Right-wing blogs are buzzing with what they view as absolute proof that Ted Cruz availed himself of the DC Madam s services while business was still booming on the elite prostitution front . Recently , Rachel Maddow reported that Deborah Palfrey s former attorney , Montgomery Blair Sibley , is ready to spill the beans on the previously-unreleased clients who were not outed as part of the original investigation . He has been in possession of these records for years , but has been prevented via restraining order from releasing them.Hundreds of names have been released , but Sibley is in possession of hundreds more and at least one of them , he says , could alter the 2016 presidential race . To date , he has not named the person or people who made an appearance in the records , but he is adamant about releasing them . Not only has the lawyer filed a request with the Supreme Court to be released from the order that prevents him from making this information public , but he has vowed to release it illegally if need be . He has also set up a dead man s switch that will release the information if something happens to him that prevents him from taking action for a period of 72 hours.Many have speculated that Ted Cruz is the name on the list , given the recent National Enquirer piece that outed five alleged Cruz mistresses including Donald Trump s current mouthpiece Katrina Pierson . Previously , Anonymous threatened to release evidence that Cruz frequented prostitutes and on April 1 , an account that claimed to be associated with the hacktivist collective did indeed tweet out a now-deleted image purporting to show Cruz among the many , many phone numbers contacted by Palfrey.First , there is no evidence to show that the account is in any way related to Anonymous . Additionally , it seems as though this alleged phone record may be a fake . A closer look at the image shows a rather suspicious typo on the Date of invoice . Specifically , it is 120/01 , a date which does not exist period.There s also the matter of the 1:32 call between 7:19 and 7:35 pm in a list that is otherwise chronological : While it is entirely possible that the records are accurate , and that the records simply contain typos , and while it is convenient and even appetizing to immediately say BOOM GOTCHA after viewing these records , it does not appear that these are legitimate . While there is almost certainly something slimy in the Evangelical Christian s past that will ultimately end him , this image ( which was released on April Fools Day ) is likely a fabrication that should be taken with the same grain of salt with which people should take everything conservatives say in general.What involvement , if any , did Cruz have with the DC Madam ? It looks like we re still going to have to wait a while.Featured image via screengrab/photoshop',\n",
       " 'BERLIN - U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s move to revise a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries will not lessen its impact on tourism , the head of the UN World Tourism Organization said . “ People don ’ t go to places where they don ’ t feel welcome , ” Taleb Rifai , the secretary general of the tourism organization , told Reuters , before the world ’ s biggest travel trade fair , ITB Berlin , opens on Wednesday . Trump on Monday signed a revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States but removing Iraq from the list , after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts . “ It ’ s not about the details of which countries are included , it ’ s about the attitude , ” Rifai said on Tuesday . Last week , he told that the United States had lost $ 185 million in one month after the first ban was introduced and stood to lose tens of millions more each month if similar policies continued . Data from travel analysis company ForwardKeys this week showed that demand for travel to the United States over the coming months had already flattened out following a positive start to the year . But any downturn in demand for travel to the United States is not expected to have an impact on travel in general . International tourist numbers are expected to grow 3 to 4 percent this year from last year ’ s 1.24 billion , Rifai said on Tuesday . “ The world has opened up in incredible ways . There are so many options now . If you want to gamble , you don ’ t have to go to Las Vegas , you can go to Macau instead , ” he said . Market researcher Euromonitor has cut its forecast for U.S. arrivals by 2020 to 84.2 million from 85.2 million amid uncertainty over the travel ban . Caroline Bremner , head of travel research at Euromonitor , said the seven countries included in the original travel ban represented only 0.1 percent of total inbound travelers there . “ And so the impact on volume is not going to be as much as the message that the U.S. is sending to business and leisure travelers around the world , about the level of international openness and type of welcome they will receive under the new government , ” she said .',\n",
       " 'Kellyanne Conway tried to baffle George Stephanopoulos with bullshit on Monday morning and got her ass handed to her with facts.Donald Trump s Muslim ban has caused worldwide chaos as airports across the country are detaining and blocking people traveling from seven countries , including green card holders who are permanent American citizens , children , and the elderly . For some reason , Trump and his team think these people are terrorism threats.But the ban not only violates constitutional rights , it is absolutely wrong about the seven countries listed because none of them are responsible for any deaths on American soil.And during an interview with George Stephanopoulos , Conway took a beating after she claimed that protesters against Trump s ban don t know the facts . I see all these protesters , Conway whined . I think if you actually surveyed them , they would probably get the facts wrong . They re being misinformed . Stephanopoulos then unleashed devastating facts , pointing out that Saudia Arabia , Egypt , and the United Arab Emirates were left off the list even though those countries were home to the 9/11 hijackers . Trump mentioned 9/11 as a reason for the executive order . None of the deadly terror attacks in this country since 9/11 have been carried out by anyone from those seven countries . Eighteen of the 19 9/11 attackers came from Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates there is no ban from that country . Those countries also happen to be countries where President Trump has significant business interests . So why weren t those countries included ? Conway responded by blaming President Obama , claiming that Obama banned Iraqi refugees for six months.But that s a lie because it appears there was only a delay in processing visa applications of Iraqi refugees in response to an actual threat . But there was no ban like Conway claims . Stephanopoulos even pointed out the inaccurate claim and informed Conway that there was a lot of media coverage at the time.Conway then whined about not getting bipartisan cooperation , which is quite hypocritical to expect since Republicans refused to work with President Obama for eight years . She also demanded that Democrats and Republicans collaborate with Trump on his tyrannical agenda , which she called an extraordinary accomplishment . I mean , Donald Trump has been on the job for , what , eight , nine , ten days . Barack Obama was here for eight years . The extraordinary accomplishments in just the first week truly are breathtaking . No reductive curating reporting , in my view , is helpful to the American public to understand . We re being very collaborative and very open . We would just like the same in return . Here s the video via Twitter.WATCH : @ GStephanopoulos interviews @ KellyannePolls about Pres .

       " 'There s no need for Barack Obama and Valerie Jarrett to make a statement about finding a cure for pediatric cancer , which receives 4 percent of The National Cancer Institute s $ 4.6 billion budget . There s no need because working together to help fund a cure for cancer doesn t divide a nation , and we all know kids can t vote Picture is from Rockstar Ronan , a website dedicated to lighting the White House gold ! Quite some time ago , a petition was circulated to Light the White House Gold . The ask was simple : Come September 1 , or the beginning of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month , put some gold lightbulbs in the spotlights out front of the White House and tell the childhood cancer community and all the kids fighting and dying of cancer that they matter.The president , through Paulette Aniskoff , Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Engagement , dropped the news that there would be no gold lights . There was a recycled proclamation , though , so maybe we should be happy for this small token . Of course , most of you will recall that last year on October 1 , a giant pink ribbon and pink lightbulbs were festooned quickly on the White House . Should the White House go pink again in a month , it will be a significant slap in the face to the childhood cancer community . Yet another gesture of inequality for our kids.Cancer remains the number one disease killer of children . Cancer kills more kids in this country than AIDS , cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy combined . So , when the long awaited response came from the president , you can understand why it was quite disappointing.Cancer kills more than 2,500 children in our country every year . Over 13,500 kids will be diagnosed with cancer in the next 365 days . Though these numbers are significant , the potential market is too small to attract the attention of private industry . This makes the role of the taxpayer-funded National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) especially critical yet approximately 4 % percent of its annual budget is dedicated to childhood cancer . The result is that children are dying every day waiting for promising new treatments that lack funding . This puts an extra burden on families with a child battling cancer.Of course , lighting the White House gold would not cure any children or provide additional research funding . But that is not the point . I would gladly choose additional funding in the federal budget over a handful of gold lightbulbs . Again , that is not the point . Childhood cancer advocates fight so hard for every ounce of awareness in an effort to translate it into additional funding . What better symbol to raise the ultimate amount of awareness than the most powerful residence on the face of the earth ? At the present time , a paltry 4 percent of the total National Cancer Institute Budget ( NCI ) is dedicated to all forms of childhood cancer . Thank you , Harold Varmus , M.D . That brings me back to the small little ask that apparently is only reserved for the ubiquitous pink ribbon.What is the message here to the childhood cancer community ? Kids with cancer do not matter as much as breast cancer ? If kids with cancer do not merit more than 4 percent of the federal research budget , and childhood cancer is not important enough to garner the simple gesture of a handful of gold lightbulbs , then what is our position ? I wish I had the answer to that question . I hope that it does not mean that children with cancer do not merit the same simple gestures and considerations as breast cancer . It certainly appears that way though.According to the news of Take Part , White House led the celebration by lighting up rainbow-colored lights . President Obama cited a statement which was quoted by takepart.com . He said , When all Americans are treated as equal , we were all more free , this ruling is a victory for America . President Obama had long been supporting marriage equality since 2012.Niagara Falls was one of the several US landmarks that lip up rainbow-colored lights for supporting same-sex marriage.Cinderella Castle in Disney World also took part of the celebration . According to Take Part , in Florida , same-sex marriage was illegal but on Friday , people and the Disney World partied as they have heard the decision , the Cinderella Castle became more enchanting with its rainbow-colored lights as they celebrated marriage equality.The St. Louis Civil Courts Building also lit up with flying rainbow colors . Alderman Shane Cohn spent $ 15,000 in capital for the improvement funds of the rainbow lights in the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis . Several downtown buildings as well lit up rainbow-colored lights as a sign of support for the gay rights and St. Louis PrideFest . accrding to the report of stltoday.com , St. Louis recently was called the gayest cities in America . Other famous landmarks which supported the same-sex marriage and brighten up with rainbow colors were Terminal Tower in Cleveland , The Empire State Building ( In September 2014 , the Empire State Building received national backlash for their decision not to go gold for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month . ) Penn Station in New York City , The Seattle Great Wheel , The Alamo in San Antonio , in San Francisco , three of their monuments have participated , including : San Francisco City Hall , San Francisco International Airport and Grace Cathedral , the Playhouse Square in Cleveland , The Davis Building in Dallas , The U.S. Grant Hotel in San Diego also participated in the celebration.Ultimately , a handful of lightbulbs and a giant gold ribbon will not find better treatments or cures for the difficult cancers that kill so many children . It will not force Harold Varmus , M.D. , to change his funding allocations . And , it may not cause more people to donate money toward childhood cancer research . All may be true . What that handful of lightbulbs and fabric may do is provide an additional measure of hope . And never should we forget that hope is a dangerous commodity , especially to a community that sometimes finds itself without any . Thanks for nothing , Mr. President .

       " 'The American taxpayers are on the hook for less than predicted but this is still huge ! It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $ 2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs , according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves , as officials had promised.Nearly $ 1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program , which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved , totaling nearly about $ 30 billion in taxpayer backing , the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $ 2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates , which found the government was poised to face $ 4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees . But as the projects have come to fruition , they ve performed better , leaving taxpayers with a shrinking though still sizable liability . As of November 2014 , DOE estimates the credit subsidy cost of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio that is , the total expected net cost over the life of the loans to be $ 2.21 billion , including $ 807 million for loans that have defaulted , the GAO said in its report to Congress.The green program loan guarantees were created in a 2005 law and boosted by the 2009 stimulus . The first applications were approved in 2009 , and through 2014 the Obama administration had issued some 38 loans and guarantees , covering 34 projects ranging from nuclear power plants to fuel-efficient vehicles to solar panels and wind-generation technology.Read more : Washington Times',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to provide $ 622.1 million to control the spread of the Zika virus , far below President Barack Obama ’ s request and lower than Senate legislation . The bill passed the Republican-controlled House 241 to 184 , largely along party lines , and sets up a confrontation with both the Republican-majority Senate and the Democratic Obama administration . The White House has threatened to veto the House bill , saying it was “ woefully inadequate. ” The Obama administration has requested $ 1.9 billion . On Tuesday , the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $ 1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus , which has been linked to birth defects . Unlike the Senate legislation , the House bill requires that the $ 622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere . Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits , while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts . House Republicans argue their bill , when coupled with $ 589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola , would provide enough money through Sept. 30 , the end of this fiscal year . It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills . U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly , a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies . The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre , a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults . Last year , Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly , and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas , with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida . The Obama administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine .',\n",
       " 'MEXICO CITY - Two-thirds of Mexicans reject offering an amnesty to members of criminal gangs as a way of reducing violence in the country , a poll showed on Monday , days after a top leftist presidential candidate floated the idea of exploring the step . At the start of December , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told supporters in the violence-wracked state of Guerrero he was prepared to analyze all the options , including an amnesty , to bring peace to Mexico after years of violence between gangs . You can t fight fire with fire , he said . Asked by a reporter whether his amnesty could include drug cartel bosses , Lopez Obrador his campaign would consider it in a recording published by newspaper El Universal . A telephone survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for El Universal showed only 23 percent of the respondents agreed somewhat or strongly with the idea of brokering an amnesty with the gangs in exchange for pledges to reduce violence . Some 66 percent took the opposite view , while eight percent said they had no opinion either way . The rest gave no answer . Violence between drug cartels and security forces has been blamed for well over 100,000 deaths in the past decade , and Mexico is on track to register its highest murder total this year since it began keeping regular monthly tallies in 1997 . Lopez Obrador , who has led most of the early polls for the July 2018 election , did not provide details about the potential scope of the amnesty , and aides to the 64-year-old consulted by have so far declined to flesh out how one might work . A former mayor of Mexico City , Lopez Obrador was runner-up in the last two elections , and his adversaries seized on the amnesty to paint the proposal as a threat to security and an affront to the victims of organized crime . A gang truce in El Salvador in 2012 initially cut violence , but when it broke down , murders soared to new heights . The Buendia & Laredo survey , which polled 600 people Dec. 7-8 , said that only 16 percent of those polled felt the amnesty would improve the security situation in Mexico , while 62 percent took the opposite view . Some 18 percent believed it would make no difference and the rest gave no answer . The poll was conducted had a margin of error of 4.0 percentage points , El Universal said .',\n",
       " 'HARARE - Zimbabwe s new president , Emmerson Mnangagwa , on Tuesday announced a three-month amnesty window for the return of public funds illegally stashed abroad by individuals and companies . Upon the expiry of the amnesty at end of February next year , the government will arrest and prosecute those who have failed to comply , Mnangagwa said in a statement . Mnangagwa was sworn-in as president on Friday and promised to tackle corruption , which had become endemic under former president Robert Mugabe s 37-year rule . Those affected are thus encouraged to take advantage of the three-month moratorium to return the illegally externalized funds and assets in order to avoid the pain and ignominy of being visited by the long arm of the law , Mnangagwa said . Zimbabwe s new president is under pressure to deliver , especially on the economy , which is in the grip of severe foreign currency shortages that have seen banks failing to give cash to customers . Mnangagwa told heads of government ministries on Tuesday that he was putting together a leaner government , which would see the merging of some departments to enhance efficiency . Critics say Zimbabwe has a bloated civil service , which chews more than 90 percent of the national budget . Mnangagwa , however , said only workers of retirement age would be laid off . He promised to rebuild the economy and improve the livelihoods of Zimbabweans . My government will have no tolerance for bureaucratic slothfulness , which is quick to brandish procedures as an excuse for stalling service delivery to citizens , investors and other stakeholders , Mnangagwa said in a statement read to the government officials . After recovering under a unity government between the ruling ZANU-PF and the opposition between 2009 and 2012 , the southern African nation s economy has unraveled with the unemployment rate above 90 percent . Mnangagwa is expected to announce a cabinet this week , with all eyes on whether he breaks with the past and names a broad-based government or selects old guard figures from Mugabe s era . An official at parliament said Mnangagwa had asked for curriculum vitaes of ZANU-PF legislators on Tuesday as he moves to put the new cabinet in place . Meanwhile , deputy parliament speaker Mabel Chinomona told the house that she had been informed by ZANU-PF that the party had recalled five legislators from parliament , indicating the five had been dismissed as ZANU-PF lawmakers . The members , all linked to the G40 group that supported Mugabe s wife Grace , include former ministers Savior Kasukuwere , Jonathan Moyo and Ignatius Chombo , who is facing corruption charges in court .',\n",
       " 'More redacted government documents covering up another scandal in Obama s most transparent government ever .Internal documents released late Friday show managers at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were aware of the potential for a catastrophic blowout at an abandoned mine that could release large volumes of wastewater laced with toxic heavy metals.EPA released the documents following weeks of prodding from The Associated Press and other media organizations . EPA and contract workers accidentally unleashed 3 million gallons of contaminated wastewater on Aug. 5 as they inspected the idled Gold King Mine near Silverton , Colorado.Among the documents is a June 2014 work order for a planned cleanup that noted that the old mine had not been accessible since 1995 , when the entrance partially collapsed . The plan appears to have been produced by Environmental Restoration , a private contractor working for EPA . This condition has likely caused impounding of water behind the collapse , the report says . ln addition , other collapses within the workings may have occurred creating additional water impounding conditions . Conditions may exist that could result in a blowout of the blockages and cause a release of large volumes of contaminated mine waters and sediment from inside the mine , which contain concentrated heavy metals . A subsequent May 2015 action plan for the mine also notes the potential for a blowout.There are at least three ongoing investigations into exactly how EPA triggered the disaster , which tainted rivers in Colorado , New Mexico and Utah with lead , arsenic and other contaminates . EPA says its water testing has shown contamination levels have since fallen back to pre-spill levels , though experts warn the heavy metals have likely sunk and mixed with bottom sediments that could someday be stirred back up.The documents , which the agency released about 10:30 p.m. eastern time , do not include any account of what happened immediately before or after the spill . The wastewater flowed into a tributary of the Animas and San Juan rivers , turning them a sickly yellow.Elected officials in affected states and elsewhere have been highly critical of the EPA s initial response . Among the unanswered questions is why it took the agency nearly a day to inform local officials in downstream communities that rely on the rivers for drinking water.Much of the text in the documents released Friday was redacted by EPA officials . Among the items blacked out is the line in a 2013 safety plan for the Gold King job that specifies whether workers were required to have phones that could work at the remote site , which is more than 11,000 feet up a mountain.EPA did not immediately respond Friday night to questions from the AP . In the wake of the spill , it has typically taken days to get any detailed response from the agency , if at all.On its website , contractor Environmental Restoration posted a brief statement last week confirming its employees were present at the mine when the spill occurred . The company declined to provide more detail , saying that to do so would violate contractual confidentiality obligations . Via : AP News',\n",
       " '- A group including former White House ethics attorneys will file a lawsuit on Monday accusing President Donald Trump of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments , in violation of the U.S. Constitution . The lawsuit , brought by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , will allege that the Constitution ’ s emoluments clause forbids payments to Trump ’ s businesses . It will seek a court order forbidding Trump from accepting such payments , said Deepak Gupta , one of the lawyers working on the case . Trump does business with countries like China , India , Indonesia and the Philippines , the group noted in a statement . “ When Trump the president sits down to negotiate trade deals with these countries , the American people will have no way of knowing whether he will also be thinking about the profits of Trump the businessman , ” it said . Trump told reporters on Monday the lawsuit was “ without merit , ” when asked about the case after signing some executive orders in the Oval Office . The White House referred questions to a law firm representing the president on ethics matters . “ We do not comment on our clients or the work we do for them , ” said the representative of the firm , Morgan Lewis & Bockius . The case is part of a wave of litigation expected to be filed against Trump by liberal advocacy groups . It will be filed in federal court in Manhattan , Gupta said , and attorneys for the plaintiffs will include Richard Painter , a former ethics lawyer in Republican President George W. Bush ’ s White House . The impending lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times . Eric Trump , one of Trump ’ s sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization , told the Times on Sunday that the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid any possible legal exposure , such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at Trump-owned hotels that come from foreign government guests to the U.S. Treasury . “ This is purely harassment for political gain , ” Trump told the newspaper . The Constitution ’ s emoluments clause states : “ No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States : And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them , shall , without the Consent of the Congress , accept of any present , Emolument , Office , or Title , of any kind whatever , from any King , Prince , or foreign State . ”',\n",

       " 'GENEVA - An independent U.N. human rights investigator said on Wednesday that he had information about an inmate being tortured at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention facility , despite Washington banning enhanced interrogation techniques almost 10 years ago . The U.S. Department of Defense denied the allegation , saying there was no credible evidence to support it . Nils Melzer , the U.N. special rapporteur on torture , said he had information that Ammar al-Baluchi - accused of being a co-conspirator in the 9/11 attacks on the United States - was being subjected to treatment that is banned under international law . His torture and ill-treatment are reported to continue , a statement from the U.N. human rights office said , without giving details of the source of Melzer s information . In addition to the long-term effects of past torture , noise and vibrations are reportedly still being used against him , resulting in constant sleep deprivation and related physical and mental disorders , for which he allegedly does not receive adequate medical attention , it said . Major Ben Sakrisson , a Pentagon spokesman , said the allegation was not true . These claims have been investigated on multiple occasions in the past and no credible evidence has been found to substantiate his claims , he said . The prison , which was opened by President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture . His successor Barack Obama ended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques via executive order in January 2009 , and reduced the inmate population to 41 , but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail . President Donald Trump asked Congress earlier this year for funds to upgrade the jail , having said during his electoral campaign that he wanted to load it up with some bad dudes . Citing a 2014 Senate investigation , the U.N. statement said al-Baluchi was said to have suffered relentless torture for three-and-a-half years in CIA black sites before being moved to Guantanamo , where he had been in a severely restricted-access facility at Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade . Al-Baluchi , a Kuwaiti-born Pakistani citizen also known as Abdul Aziz Ali , is the nephew and alleged co-conspirator of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . Melzer said the ban on torture and ill-treatment was one of the most fundamental norms of international law and could not be justified in any circumstances , and called for prosecution of U.S. officials who had carried out torture . By failing to prosecute the crime of torture in CIA custody , the U.S. is in clear violation of the Convention against Torture and is sending a dangerous message of complacency and impunity to officials in the U.S. and around the world , Melzer said in the statement . He said he had renewed a long-standing request to visit Guantanamo Bay to interview inmates , but he and his predecessors in the role had consistently been denied access . A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that the U.S. constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and requires humane conditions of confinement , including that of solitary confinement . We support the work of the U.N. special rapporteurs and the United States has a long history of engaging constructively on matters within mandates of the special rapporteurs , he said .',\n",
       " 'UNITED NATIONS - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to Myanmar authorities on Tuesday to end violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country s Rakhine state , warning of the risk of ethnic cleansing and regional destabilization . He also urged the Security Council to press for restraint and calm , sending the 15-member body a rare letter to express concern that the violence could spiral into a humanitarian catastrophe with implications for peace and security that could continue to expand beyond Myanmar s borders . Nearly 125,00 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state since the violence began on Aug. 25 , when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base . The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people . When asked if the violence could be described as ethnic cleansing , Guterres told reporters on Tuesday : We are facing a risk , I hope we don t get there . I appeal to all , all authorities in Myanmar , civilian authorities and military authorities , to indeed put an end to this violence that , in my opinion , is creating a situation that can destabilize the region , he said . Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October . Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force them out with a campaign of arson and killings . The U.N. Security Council met behind closed doors last week to be briefed on the situation at the request of Britain . If it continues to deteriorate then one of the things that we can do is to hold further meetings to shine a spotlight on the situation there , Britain s U.N . Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said on Monday . The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi , accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution . Under the rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter , Guterres can bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security . While Guterres letter does not specifically involve Article 99 , he writes that the international community has a responsibility to undertake concerted efforts to prevent further escalation of the crisis .',\n",
       " \"Earlier this week , prominent members of the GOP like Mitt Romney , John McCain and Marco Rubio attacked President Trump for condemning both sides for the violence in Charlottesville , VA last weekend . Today , two police officers were killed in an apparent ambush today in Kissimmee , Florida . Both men woke up , put their uniforms on and committed to protecting total strangers . Instead of protecting them , these two brave men , Officer Matthew Baxter and Sergeant Sam Howard were ambushed and murdered by the cowards police believe dialed 911 for help.On the other side of the nation , at almost the same time that two innocent police officers were being murdered , brave Boston police officers and Massachusetts State Police were defending 50 pro-free speech Americans , who were surrounded by 30,000 hateful and violent protesters who were threatening American citizens for daring to take a stand for the First Amendment . The pro free-speech Americans had to be carted away in by police in wagons , as violent leftists waited for them to exit the Boston Commons area where they gathered with American flags and peacefully spoke to one another about the importance of free speech in America.Here s a picture of some of the White Supremacists defending free-speech in Boston today : https : //twitter.com/TruthinGov2016/status/898987969373011969Watch CNN totally lie to their viewers , as they twist the narrative of the FREE SPEECH rally , calling it an Alt-Right rally : # BlackLivesMatter organized march started in Boston against racism & Alt-light rally at # BostonCommon & in solidarity w # Charlottesville . pic.twitter.com/hEljI0lyxG Sara Sidner ( @ sarasidnerCNN ) August 19 , 2017Brave Boston police officers were deployed to keep the peace . Keeping 30,000 angry leftists away from 50 peaceful Americans is no easy task when you have people on the left who are itching for a fight . Their fight is not just with Americans who want to protect our First Amendment Right to free speech , it s also with the cops . Former GOP presidential candidates like Mitt Romney , John McCain and Marco Rubio took to social media to trash President Trump for not embracing the violent left ( the same groups of leftist agitators who were in Charlottesville that are now in Boston ) . What these sore losers have clearly forgotten is how Barack Obama and his administrations embraced the war on our law enforcement . What these clowns don t see is that cops being murdered or innocent Americans being beaten bloody because they don t hold the same leftist views is never going to end , unless we have a leader who is willing to call them out.Watch this large group surround and threaten one young man who was all by himself because he was wearing a Trump hat . Can anyone imagine this happening to anyone wearing an Obama hat while he was president ? How about you Mitt Romney ? Are you okay with this ?

       " 'MOSCOW - The Kremlin says U.S. intelligence agency allegations it ran an influence campaign to help President-elect Donald Trump win the White House are false . But if U.S. spies are right , Moscow may wish it hadn ’ t bothered to meddle in the first place . The belief , widely held in the West , that the Kremlin helped discredit Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by orchestrating embarrassing media leaks , has relegated U.S.-Russia relations to a post-Cold War low and stoked fears Russia will try to subvert French and German elections this year . And true or not , the bipartisan view that Russia tried to help Trump , supported by a classified U.S. intelligence report , may make it harder , not easier , for Trump to make common cause with President Vladimir Putin , something both men say they want . In the latest wrinkle , U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Trump has been presented with claims that Russia had compromising information about him . The accusations are uncorroborated and denied by the Kremlin . “ There was initial delight in Russia when Trump won and there was more delight after Trump picked Rex Tillerson as secretary of state , ” said Alexei Makarkin , deputy director at the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies . “ There is significantly less delight now. ” Former Exxon-Mobil CEO Tillerson , Trump ’ s pick for America ’ s top diplomat , is seen as a friend of Russia . His firm has been thwarted from carrying out a huge project in the Russian Arctic by economic sanctions imposed by the outgoing Obama administration to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine . Makarkin said Trump and his circle would now be accused of being Kremlin stooges every time they pushed for detente with Russia , with senior Republicans likely to warn that any rapprochement would hand political capital to the Democrats . Putin , who has repeatedly praised Trump ’ s political skills , is hoping his incoming U.S. counterpart will ease or annul the sanctions , stay out of Russia ’ s domestic affairs , and maybe even team up with the Kremlin in the Middle East . But the furor over hacking and allegations of wider Russian interference have triggered pressure from Democrats and Trump ’ s fellow Republicans in Congress for tougher , not weaker , anti-Russian measures . That has amplified Congressional calls for an independent bipartisan investigation into Russian dirty tricks and prompted President Barack Obama to expel 35 suspected Russian spies , denting early Russian optimism about a Trump presidency . When the announcement that Trump had won the Nov. 8 presidential election was made in Russia ’ s parliament by Vyacheslav Nikonov , the grandson of Stalin ’ s foreign minister , lawmakers erupted in applause . In Moscow , Clinton was widely seen as being anti-Russian . Two months later , the mood has soured . “ The new hacking allegations against Russia are clearly timed to coincide with the handover of power in the United States , ” Alexei Pushkov , a senator who sits on the upper house of parliament ’ s defense and security committee , said . “ The aim is to force Trump into enmity with Russia. ” Victoria Zhuravleva , an expert on U.S.-Russia relations who writes analytical papers for the government , said the current mood in the United States meant Trump would struggle to improve relations with Moscow even if he wanted to . “ If we are realistic we have nothing to wait for , ” said Zhuravleva , who said Congress could stymie Trump ’ s Russia policies and would probably present him with proposals to hit Moscow with fresh sanctions rather than roll back existing ones . To be sure , some observers of U.S.-Russian relations say the Kremlin still emerges from the affair with a major win : the new U.S. president favors closer ties with Russia and has named people who share that view to key posts . And Trump can plow ahead with rapprochement even if some in Washington oppose it . “ The Constitution privileges the Executive in war and foreign policy , ” Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones , author of ‘ We Know All About You : The Story of Surveillance in Britain and America , ’ wrote in e-mailed comments . “ Once Trump and Putin begin to play together ( if they do ) , the hacking issue will become a minor historical footnote. ” But with U.S.-Russia tensions so strained , some in Russia fret Washington will strike back with its own cyber attack . German Klimenko , Putin ’ s Internet adviser , has suggested Russia must be ready to disconnect itself or to be involuntarily cut off from the global Internet . “ America could say it will throw up virtual borders to protect itself from ( external ) influence , ” Klimenko told Reuters . “ I can imagine ... any actions. ” With so much focus on alleged Russian meddling , attention is now turning to presidential elections in France and Germany this year with some European politicians and intelligence services warning Moscow will try to interfere there too . The Kremlin ’ s preferences appear clear from state media , where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been denigrated as ‘ an old witch. ’ French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and center-right Francois Fillon have both been portrayed more positively . Former intelligence agents and cyber experts say neither country has the technical ability to protect itself or fully understand by whom and how it is being hacked , creating a rich opportunity for disinformation and unverifiable claims . Several intelligence experts said elements of Russia ’ s intelligence community won ’ t be able to resist trying to replicate their U.S. election operations in European elections — even while other parts of the ruling elite see such operations as highly risky . “ This publicity ( around the U.S. election ) made Russia look so powerful that it almost provokes them to try their hand elsewhere , ” said Andrei Soldatov , co-author of Red Web , which examines how the FSB security service uses the Internet . Yuri Felshtinsky , a friend of murdered Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko and an expert in the Russian intelligence services , said Europe should brace itself . “ During the U.S. campaign Russia created a very powerful tool to influence elections . This tool , including hacking and the creation of web sites involved in publishing fake news , will now be used everywhere . ”',\n",
       " 'Why is there so much secrecy when it comes to the mainstream media and the alleged lesbian relationship between Hillary and her aide of 20 years , Huma Abedin ? ABC News admits that the allegations against Ted Cruz have not been confirmed by them . But what the hell , why not do a story on it anyhow and see if they can make the sleazy image of a cheating Ted Cruz stick ABC News At a news conference while campaigning in Wisconsin today , Ted Cruz denied a recently released National Enquirer report that claims political operatives are looking into rumors that Cruz had multiple marital infidelities.Cruz blamed the report on Donald Trump and his henchmen and gave Trump a new nickname of Sleazy Donald . Let me be clear this National Enquirer story is garbage , Cruz said today . It is complete and utter lies . It is a tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen . Cruz has been in a war of words with Trump over tweets Trump had been sending . Trump tweeted Tuesday he would spill the beans about Cruz s wife without providing further information and retweeted Wednesday a split photo of Heidi and his wife Melania Trump , with the text : No need to spill the beans . The images are worth a thousand words . The National Enquirer allegations have not been confirmed by ABC News.Meanwhile , we can t find any reports from the same outlets who eagerly reported on Ted Cruz s alleged affairs that also picked up the National Enquirer story about the lesbian affair between Hillary Clinton and her aide of 20 years , Huma Abedin : Hillary Clinton isn t just caught in a political scandal over her missing emails from her stint as secretary of state she s also terrified of personal revelations about a secret lesbian lifestyle ! Now a world-exclusive investigation by The National ENQUIRER reveals that some of the presidential candidate s famously deleted emails are packed full of lesbian references and her lovers names . I don t think she s so concerned about emails referring to her as secretly gay , said a Clinton insider . That s been out for years her real fear is that the names of some of her lovers would be made public ! The ENQUIRER learned the list of Hillary s lesbian lovers includes a beauty in her early 30s who has often traveled with Hillary ; a popular TV and movie star ; the daughter of a top government official ; and a stunning model who got a career boost after allegedly sleeping with Hillary . Hillary made the huge mistake of mixing public and private messages while using her personalized email server before risking a massive scandal by refusing to make the documents public . That s clearly why she went to the extraordinary step of deleting everything , the high-ranking source told The ENQUIRER . [ quote_box_center ] Ronald Kessler , who wrote The First Family Detail : Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents , writes in The Daily Mail that Abedin was at times dismissive of reasonable orders from agents and at other times treated them like her personal servants.While agents are not supposed to carry luggage , they will do so as a courtesy if they like a female protectee , such as Lynne Cheney or Rosalynn Carter.But with Abedin , the agents were just like , Hey , you re going to be like that ? Well , you get your own luggage to the car . Oh , and by the way , you can carry the first lady s luggage to the car , too . She d have four bags , and we d stand there and watch her and say , Oh , can we hold the door open for you ? . . .. . . There s not an agent in the service who wants to be in Hillary s detail , a current agent says . If agents get the nod to go to her detail , that s considered a form of punishment among the agents . She s hard to work around , she s known to snap at agents and yell at agents and dress them down to their faces , and they just have to be humble and say , Yes ma am , and walk away . [ /quote_box_center ] Hillary is particularly concerned about intimate emails to longtime aide Huma Abedin who married U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner in a ceremony that many ridiculed as a political arrangement . Anthony later resigned over extramarital sexting scandals , after porn star Sydney Leathers said that she believed he was in an open marriage . I think a lot of the time when we were speaking , Huma was probably with Hillary , she charged , at the time.One exchange between the women had Hillary mistakenly responding to political correspondence with an email that seemed to be about decorating.Added the insider : That makes you wonder if any sensitive information was sent to her romantic partners ! The scandal unraveled in March , when Hillary revealed she deleted over 30,000 emails , insisting the messages were just things you typically find in inboxes . Via : National Enquirer',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump drew a line in the sand : Pass the Obamacare repeal and replace bill or else.Then it blew up in his face . Republicans created a bill so unpopular that he couldn t even get it to pass the House . Trump told them to pass the bill anyway and Republicans ignored him . The legendary dealmaker failed spectacularly . So he s blaming Democrats.In a presser held shortly after he and Paul Ryan agreed to pull the bill rather than face a humiliating defeat during voting , Trump said this outcome was actually better than passing the bill because now the Affordable Care Act will collapse on its own . If that reeks of desperation , it only got worse from there . Just two minutes in , Trump claimed the failure of this Republican bill made Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer the real losers .

They have Obamacare for a little bit longer until it ceases to exist , which it will at some point in the near future . The fact that Democrats own Obamacare isn t exactly breaking news . They ve owned it for seven years , and in the meantime , the president whose name is on it was re-elected in a landslide . It seems unlikely that Schumer or Pelosi are particularly worried about the ACA being seen as Democrat healthcare . The healthcare bill is currently at its most popular point ever.Despite Republican lawmakers efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , a new survey shows that support for the health care law has reached an all-time high.According to the Pew Research Center which conducted the poll , 54 percent of 1,503 adults surveyed between February 7 and 12 approve of the law while 43 percent disapprove.As ever , Trump is showing the country that he has an inability to accept responsibility for his actions . When he strikes out , he blames everyone but himself . It s the judges . It s the illegal voters . It s the media . It s the Democrats . It s never Donald J. Trump , epic buffoon .

       " 'WASHINGTON - The Trump International Hotel in Washington is not in violation of federal conflict-of-interest rules that bar elected officials from taking part in a lease of federal property , the U.S. General Services Administration said on Thursday . Critics argued that the luxury hotel housed in the historic Old Post Office a few blocks from the White House was a conflict of interest for Republican President Donald Trump because he is both landlord and tenant of the building . Lawyers for the hotel said the claim had no merit . Democratic lawmakers asked the GSA , which oversees federal property , to clarify the status of the lease arrangement . “ We would like to thank the GSA for their diligent review of this matter , ” Amanda Miller , a spokeswoman for the hotel , said in an email . In January , Trump said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire , but hand control to his two oldest sons while president . His eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , subsequently took the reins of the Washington hotel . In a letter from GSA contracting officer Kevin Terry to Donald Trump Jr. , the agency said the issue had been resolved by the younger Trump taking over as head of the company that runs the hotel and by changes to its internal operating agreement . The GSA said the company , the Trump Old Post Office LLC , was in full compliance with the section of the lease prohibiting elected federal officials from having any part of it . The hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue has become a rallying point for anti-Trump protesters . Two Democratic U.S. congressmen , Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Peter DeFazio of Oregon , voiced displeasure with the GSA decision . “ Any elected official can now defy the restriction by following this blueprint , ” they said in an email statement , calling the agency ’ s letter “ completely inadequate. ” “ This decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so Donald Trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the White House , ” they added . “ This is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent. ” A Washington restaurant sued the president and Trump Old Post Office LLC this month , claiming patrons had shifted business there to curry favor with his administration . A Trump Organization attorney said the lawsuit lacked merit .',\n",

       " 'You know how we can tell Rand Paul s campaign for president is out of money and out of hope ? He produced a cartoon that attacks his former ally in the Senate , Ted Cruz , which features ugly , simplistic animation and voices performed by a cheap online vocal processor , Xtranormal style.The cartoon shows two stick figures , a man and a woman , standing in a the middle of nowhere discussing how Ted Cruz borrowed money from Goldman Sachs , while also accepting huge donations from the financial sector and special interests to pay for his campaign for U.S. Senate.The title of the video ? Audit the Ted . Get it ? The characters suggest we should engage in a process similar to the conspiracy theory meme about auditing the Federal Reserve.Here s a typical exchange : MALE STICK FIGURE : Does the Goldman Sachs want to audit the Fed ? FEMALE STICK FIGURE : I don t think so . They are the Fed . Huh ? The male stick figure goes on to pitch Rand Pand , saying in his inexplicably British-sounding robot voice , He is for individual liberty , the free market and auditing the Fed . Yes , Rand Paul is for individual liberty except for a woman s individual liberty to have a safe and legal abortion , or to acquire inexpensive birth control through Obamacare , which Rand Paul wants to repeal.The female stick figure , whose stick figure lady parts aren t included in Rand Paul s definition of individual liberty , replies , Yes , I like this Rand Paul . And his hair . Maybe he should audit the Ted as well . Now we know for sure it s a robot voice .

       " 'RIYADH - U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital will stoke violence in the region , former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said , dismissing reports of prior consultations made with Riyadh over the move . It is a very bad decision . The consequences will be more bloodshed , more conflict rather than peaceful resolution , Prince Turki , a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington , told in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh . Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . Most countries say the city s status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians . Saudi Arabia condemned the decision . Saudi King Salman told President Trump that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of Muslims , official media reported . But Saudi Arabia stopped short of calling for any Arab action against the decision . Palestinian officials say Riyadh has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan . The reaction here was total surprise , said Prince Turki , who now holds no government office but remains influential . ... If there has been prior consultation or anything like that , why would the King go through the process of telling him ( Trump ) this is a bad idea and make that known publicly ? I don t think there ever was any discussion of this before the decision was taken , he added . As regards possible Saudi and Arab action in response to Trump s decision , Prince Turki said : I am sure lots of people would prefer to have something just for the sake of appearance but I don t think that s how the Saudi government operates . If it is going to take action , it is going to be a serious action . Four Palestinian officials , who spoke on condition they not be named , said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner , the president s son-in-law and adviser , are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018 . Arab officials say the plan is still in its early phases of development . Prince Turki said he was unaware of details of any such plan . Prince Turki is a son of King Faisal , who was assassinated in 1975 . His brother , Saud al-Faisal , served as foreign minister for 40 years until 2015 , and their branch of the family is seen as influential over Saudi foreign policy , even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has solidified his authority . Prince Saud championed a 2002 Arab peace initiative which called for normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel in return for Israel s withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war . In a letter to Trump published in a Saudi newspaper on Dec. 11 , Prince Turki said that Trump s opportunistic Jerusalem move would threaten security in the region . The now much diminished terrorist international gets a rejuvenation boost from you and re-energizes its recruitment of volunteers to broaden their murderous attacks on innocent civilians , worldwide , he wrote in his letter . Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom . The ambitious young prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia s ultra-strict social restrictions , scaling back the role of religious morality police , permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year . Prince Turki said that Saudis share in the blame for the spread of extremist ideology through funding of mosques abroad that may have fallen into the wrong hands , but that such funding stopped since the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States . The kingdom has been the victim of such people and such activity ... Since Sept. 11 the kingdom has had a sustained and continuous program opposing extremist ideology , not just in the kingdom but abroad , he told Reuters . For a period of time , yes it is true there were some Saudis who promoted issues of extremism and so on . Now we are getting rid of all of those . I would say we have gotten rid of most of them , if not all of them .',\n",
       " 'NBC was called out by conservative news outlets , like Breitbart for refusing to disclose Matt Lauer s ties to the Clinton Foundation prior to his 30 minutes during NBC s Commander-in-Chief forum where he basically ignored every Hillary scandal during his interview with her . The longtime Today Show co-host had ties to the Clinton Foundation . Lauer was once listed as a notable member of The Clinton Global Initiative , the fundraising conduit of the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation.Today , another close friend of the Clinton s saw his career as the highest paid morning host come to an abrupt end over sexual misconduct and assault allegations , as NBC announced that Matt Lauer had been fired from the Today Show . Variety spoke with 10 past and present workers at the company who accused Lauer of a vast array of sexual misconduct , including the woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted by the show s long-time anchor beginning in 2014 at the Sochi Olympics.That woman also shared her account with the human resources and legal departments of NBC News on Monday.NBC launched an investigation into her claims on Tuesday morning which ultimately led to Lauer s firing that same evening . That swift response was still not enough for some women however , who said their complaints to executives at the company fell on deaf ears.Those interviewed said it was at the OIympic Games where Lauer made moves on a number of female staff members . Lauer would invite women employed by NBC late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics in various cities over the years , claims Variety reporter Ramin Setoodeh . He later told colleagues how his wife had accompanied him to the London Olympics because she didn t trust him to travel alone . None of the 10 individuals who spoke with Variety are identified in the piece , including the woman who got the sex toy along with an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her . That woman said she was mortified , while a fellow co-worker s state was described as visibly shaken after Lauer allegedly flashed her in his office.When she did not do anything , Lauer reportedly reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act . His office was in a secluded space , and he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up , writes Setoodeh . This afforded him the assurance of privacy . It allowed him to welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him . That information came courtesy of two of the women who spoke with the writer of the piece . He couldn t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people because he s Matt Lauer and he s married . So he d have to do it within his stable , where he exerted power , and he knew people wouldn t ever complain . While not named , one woman , in particular , seemed to catch Lauer s eye according to thse interviewed for the piece . Several employees recall how he paid intense attention to a young woman on his staff that he found attractive , focusing intently on her career ambitions , reads the story . And he asked the same producer to his hotel room to deliver him a pillow . Lauer s fixation on women s bodies and physical appearance is also a big part of the story , with multiple people saying that he would often play the game F * * * , Marry or Kill with staffers.One of the show s anchors would often gossip about Lauer s sexual escapades according to staffers while a former reporter said : Management sucks there .

       " 'On the day of the Iowa Caucus , Sarah Palin visited the Today Show to stump for her new best friend , Donald Trump . Unfortunately , Palin seemed under the impression that she was allowed to dictate what the hosts asked her about . Hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie weren t having it.Palin , who often claims the media is against her by asking her questions she doesn t know the answers to , got off to a rocky start almost immediately , when the hosts challenged her on several issues that made both Trump and Palin look like raging hypocrites . At one point , a frustrated Palin asked the hosts Who are we to judge one another s level of Christian faith ? the scalding steam of irony coming from a person who once spent a great deal of time trying to suggest President Obama was a secret Muslim was hot enough to melt steel.But things took a dramatic turn when Guthrie asked about her son Track , who was recently just arrested for beating his girlfriend and threatening to shoot himself in the head with an AR-15 . Palin , ever the spindoctor , blamed the ugly incident on wait for it Obama . At a Trump rally , the one time vice presidential candidate claimed Track came back from Iraq messed up because Obama didn t respect the troops enough.When Guthrie asked her to clarify those baffling remarks , Palin became extremely angry . You guys brought me here to talk about Iowa politics and the caucus tonight , not to talk about my kids , she fired back . And that was a promise . But as things go in the world of media , you guys don t always keep your promises , evidently , Palin added.Watch @ SarahPalinUSA speak out on TODAY in exclusive interview . # IowaTODAY https : //t.co/Kbol2A7w9x TODAY ( @ TODAYshow ) February 1 , 2016She went on to claim the media lied when they said she blamed Obama then IMMEDIATELY doubled down . What I have blamed President Obama in doing , she said , putting her foot slowly in her mouth on live television , is this level of disrespect for the United States military that is made manifest in gutting budgets and not trying to beef it up and let our military do the job that they are trained to do . To be clear , the budgets that Obama has cut have been on the level of wasteful spending on , say , military vehicles that even the Pentagon says it didn t need . On the flipside , Republicans in congress have killed the budget for supporting veterans , like Palin s son , when they come home . Repeatedly , conservative lawmakers have cited big government and out of control spending to justify slashing funds to Veteran s Affairs and other bills meant to help wounded servicemembers . There is certainly a lack of respect for the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan but it s not coming from the White House.As usual , Palin uses her own victim-complex serve as a security blanket she can hide under when questions get to tough . Palin has repeatedly blamed President Obama for hurting the troops . That s a serious accusation and a fair one for reporters to question . The criticisms themselves may be pathetic , but her refusal to tolerate any pushback on them is even more embarrassing.If Trump had hoped Palin would be a big asset to his campaign , so far it hasn t appeared that way . At almost every appearance , Palin s performance has been a trainwreck . On the TODAY show , she was at least able to string two sentences together without devolving into a hopeless wordsalad , but it s pretty sad that this is considered a victory for her .

       " 'Obama s historic Embracing the Communists Tour wouldn t be complete without a stop in Vietnam All on the American taxpayers dime , of course In the weeks leading up to Memorial Day and President Barack Obama s scheduled trip to Vietnam , a prominent Vietcong communist leader privately thanked American anti-war activists for helping defeat the U.S.-allied government in Vietnam in the 1970s , saying protest demonstrations throughout the United States were extremely important in contributing to Vietnam s victory . For Vietnamese guerrilla leader Madam Nguyen Thi Binh , who sent the private letter from Hanoi dated April 20 , victory meant the communist takeover of South Vietnam . The letter addressed veteran American anti-war activists who gathered in Washington , D.C. , at a May 3 reunion of radical May Day anti-war leaders.The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained a copy of the letter at the meeting.Binh , now age 90 , originally served as the highest ranking Vietnamese delegate to the Paris Peace Talks that imposed a ceasefire in the country in 1973.The Vietcong was a ragtag group of communist guerrillas who were allied with the official communist government in North Vietnam . The country was cut in two in 1954 , with the south seeking to build a democratic state allied to the West.Binh s frank admission highlights a secret side of the communist s effective lobbying influence in the United States . Rather than live in the southern part of the country , which for decades she represented as a diplomat , it appears after the war Binh was living in Hanoi , the original capital of North Vietnam.In her letter , she extolled the American anti-war movement , saying it was a key component that advanced the communist takeover of South Vietnam . The Vietnamese people have great appreciation for the peace and antiwar movements in the United States and view those movements contribution as important in shortening the war , she wrote and which was read to an assembled group of May Day anti-war activists in Washington , D.C.The May Day tribe consisted of thousands of radical anti-war protesters bent on shutting down Washington , D.C. , in May 1971 through three days of massive civil disobedience . More than 12,000 protesters were arrested , for filling the streets to block feds from getting to work.The Nixon administration was so fearful of violence against federal employees , it deployed 5,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division and thousands more from the Marine Corps barracks to protect the 14th Street Bridge , a major thoroughfare into the nation s capital from Virginia.The protesters rallying cry was , if the government won t stop the war , we ll stop the government . The war temporarily ended in 1973 when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed that imposed a ceasefire on all parties.That ceasefire was abruptly broken in 1975 , however , when the North Vietnamese forces launched a surprise Spring Offensive . Leading the offensive were hundreds of T-54 and T-55 heavy Russian tanks that left secret sanctuaries in neighboring Cambodia and flooded into South Vietnam . Regular North Vietnamese troops spearheaded the offensive , along with guerrillas tied to the Vietcong , which also called themselves the National Liberation Front of Vietnam.By the time the Russian tanks were about to drive into Saigon , a liberal Congress filled with anti-war lawmakers already had hamstrung their South Vietnamese allies . Congress cut military aid to Saigon by 50 percent and handcuffed the South Vietnamese military facing the communist onslaught by barring any U.S. air support or other meaningful military assistance to the government.The offensive was relatively quick , trapping hundreds of thousands of pro-American Vietnamese troops and millions of civilians who had trusted Washington and openly supported the United States.The lasting images of those dark , chaotic days were captured by American news networks , which showed the panic in the capital city.Harrowing pictures depicted U.S. helicopters frantically trying to ferry thousands of panic-stricken Vietnamese citizens and U.S. officials off the roof of the American Embassy . The videos depicted Vietnamese clinging from helicopters in a desperate effort to escape the onrushing communist army.The defeat ultimately triggered an international humanitarian crisis where at least 800,000 Vietnamese boat people fled their communist conquerors . Many bravely undertook perilous journeys in small boats across the Gulf of Thailand to escape the new communist warlords . An unknown number of refugees drowned in the exodus.After the communists defeated the South Vietnamese army , more than 1 million South Vietnamese citizens who had supported the United States were left behind and imprisoned in re-education camps . About 100,000 faced summary execution by the communist victors.Bill Cowan , who was a Purple Heart Marine platoon leader in Vietnam , told TheDCNF that U.S. troops were demoralized when the U.S. media only highlighted anti-war protesters and not the heroism of many of the Vietnamese who were trying to keep their country free . The media fueled the anti-war movement , empowering the protestors , the North Vietnamese , and the Vietcong , he told TheDCNF . It was rare to have a good news story about what was happening there , Cowan said . I recall a reporter coming to interview me at the village I was living at and apologizing after she was done by saying , You know , this story will probably never see the light of day . My editors will quash it because it has too many good things in here about what you guys are doing . Cowan told TheDCNF.Fred Rustmann , a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was deployed in Vietnam for two years and later assigned to cover the Paris Peace Talks where Binh was the chief Vietcong delegate , called her a great propagandist . She was really the propaganda arm of the Vietcong . And she was very effective . She was living in a villa in Paris in the southern suburbs , which was a very communist , socialist neighborhood , Rustmann told TheDCNF in an interview . He said ironically Binh spent more time in Paris than in Vietnam.In Paris , she was regularly interviewing with leftist news organization . She had these leftist kids and try to influence them . I believe she met several times with Jane Fonda . Binh actually recalled in her latest letter many meetings she had with American anti-war activists . She wrote , The first time I met representatives of the American anti-war movement was at a week-long conference held in Bratislava in 1967 , with the attendees of about forty Americans . Before parting , we were shaking hands , holding hands , she recalled in her letter , adding , During the war years , I also met many other Americans in different places organized by U.S. citizen groups opposed to the war . Obama visited Vietnam last week for a three-day trip , and hailed its communist leadership and downplayed the human rights problems that persist.Hours before Air Force One touched down , Vietnam had scheduled national elections for its one-party National Assembly . Reminiscent of previous old communist regimes from the Soviet Union days , the state-run press reported that 98.77 percent of the public voted in the election.Only one sentence in Obama s main speech to the Vietnamese public made any reference to human rights problems in the country.Vietnamese government officials also blocked dissidents from meeting with Obama or his advisers when the American delegation arrived in Ho Chi Minh City , formerly Saigon . White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said it shows the meeting was the source of significant discomfort for Vietnam s rulers . Via : Daily Caller',\n",

       " 'DUBLIN - It is not yet clear if Britain and the European Union can agree on written assurances to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border by a Monday deadline , Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday . But he said he was hopeful a meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday would lead to a deal in time for a Dec. 14-15 EU summit . That would allow Britain to move on to talks on its future trading relations with the bloc . Avoiding a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before talks begin on the future trade relationship and a two-year Brexit transition . Tusk said he had asked May to put a final offer on the table by Monday , but Coveney suggested agreement on the wording of written reassurances may come later . The hope is that those [ Monday ] meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders summit the week after ... and can allow this Brexit negotiation process to open up to phase two of discussions , Coveney told RTE radio . Asked if he expected an agreed text of written British assurances on the issue Monday morning , Coveney said : Let s not run before we can walk here . Obviously , we would like that to be the case . The Irish cabinet is to meet at 0900 GMT on Monday and give Prime Minister Leo Varadkar a mandate to make a decision on the border issue . That may or may not be on the back of an agreed wording . That remains to be seen over the next number of hours , Coveney said . Ireland is not asking the British government to do the impossible and provide a detailed plan border will work , but rather for clear principles for the second phase of talks to eliminate the possibility of a hard border . What we have to make sure here is that we don t have an unintended consequence of the re-emergence of a [ hard ] border , he said . We can t allow that and we won t allow that .',\n",
       " 'NAIROBI - Kenyan police fired teargas on Tuesday at supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta who were protesting outside the Supreme Court against the invalidation of his Aug. 8 re-election , witnesses said . The Supreme Court nullified the presidential election on Sept. 1 and ordered the electoral body to hold a repeat vote within 60 days . The court , which issued a majority judgment , said there were irregularities in tallying results of the poll . David Maraga , the chief justice and president of the Supreme Court , said threats against judicial staff had risen since the ruling . Since the Supreme Court delivered judgment ... these threats have become more aggressive , Maraga told a news conference at the Supreme Court , as hundreds of protesters wearing the bright red of Kenyatta s Jubilee party gathered outside . He cited the demonstrations outside the court as an example of the rising threats , and threatening messages sent on social media to individual judges and their staff . Senior political leaders have also threatened the judiciary , promising to cut it down to size and teach us a lesson , Maraga said , adding that judges would not be intimidated by anyone and were ready to pay the ultimate price to protect the constitution and rule of law . Maraga accused the inspector general of police of repeatedly ignoring calls to act , exposing judicial officers , property and litigants to danger . George Kinoti , the national police spokesman , denied the accusations , saying the police had provided bodyguards to judges and protection for their homes and the courts . The truth is borne out of facts and they are plain for any citizen to check and confirm , Kinoti said in a statement . The protesters waved placards and shouted slogans against the judiciary and Maraga himself . I have attended this protest to air my grievances after the Supreme Court annulled my candidate s victory , one of the protesters told Reuters . There was a commotion after the teargas was fired , before the protesters regrouped and continued with their protest outside the court building . They were eventually dispersed by further rounds of teargas . The Supreme Court , which gave a summary of its findings when it invalidated Kenyatta s election victory , said it would read its detailed ruling on Wednesday at 0700 GMT . Opposition leader Raila Odinga , who lost by 1.4 million votes to Kenyatta in the annulled poll , has said he will not take part in a repeat vote scheduled for Oct. 17 , unless some staff at the electoral commission are fired , among other demands . The heads of Western diplomatic missions in Kenya , including those of the European Union , the United States and Britain , urged Kenyan leaders to avoid comments that could incite hatred and violence . Now is the time to focus on preparing for the new poll , which , in line with the Court s order and the Constitution , must be run by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and be held by the end of October , they said in a joint statement .',\n",

       " 'COX S BAZAR , Bangladesh - The World Health Organization ( WHO ) began distributing 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine on Tuesday in Bangladesh s camps for Rohingya refugees fleeing from Myanmar , as authorities rush to prevent a major outbreak of the deadly disease . More than 10,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported in the past week alone , the WHO said . Doctors in two clinics have told that there have been several cases of patients with the symptoms of cholera , a virulent diarrhea that kills within 36 hours if not treated . Cholera has not been identified in testing of patient samples by Bangladesh s health ministry , although clinics say they are waiting for results for some samples sent last week . There is a clear risk for cholera , said Dr N. Paranietharan , the WHO s representative in Bangladesh . Sporadic cases are inevitable ( but ) we are not expecting a major outbreak like Yemen , he said . War-torn Yemen is in the grip of a cholera crisis , with more than 750,000 sufferers afflicted by the bacteria , which is spread when contaminated faeces is ingested by humans , usually through the water supply . The cholera vaccination campaign in Bangladesh , the second largest in history , will be crucial to containing any outbreak , said Paranietharan . More than 1,000 people will fan out across the sprawling camps on the southern tip of Bangladesh that are home to more than 519,000 Rohingya Muslims . The Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar when government forces launched a ferocious offensive , denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing , in response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 . In pounding heat and stifling humidity , traumatized and malnourished refugees are crammed into bamboo and canvas huts packed across muddy hillsides . Faeces lies in lanes that flood in the pouring rain . More than 3,000 latrines have been installed but many overflow and sit above pools and creeks where refugees bathe . Many new wells for drinking water are shallow and have become contaminated by sewage , said Paranietharan . While we are doing this vaccination , it is not an alternative to fixing the water , sanitation and hygiene intervention , it just buys us time , he said . Sanitary facilities and hygiene promotion have still not met the standards . They need to be improved quickly . In a dysentery clinic in Kutupalong camp run by the Medical Teams International group , patients with severe diarrhea lie motionless , moaning as intravenous fluid flows into them . I believe we are facing a tsunami . We just don t know if it s going to be 10 feet or 50 feet , said Bruce Murray , a physician at the clinic . Cholera is known to be endemic in Bangladesh and now we are bringing in half a million people in squalid conditions and it s got to be inevitable . It s a matter of when it hits , rather than if , he said . Murray said there could be tens of thousands of victims in an outbreak . Paranietharan said his organization had the capacity to handle 70,000 cholera cases . As well as a handful of clinics , mobile teams are ready to go to inaccessible parts of the camps with oral rehydration salts that can save cholera patients if they can t get access to intravenous fluids . Aid workers worry they lack the staff to get the vaccines out quickly , while the WHO says it urgently needs $ 10.2 million to do the job properly . The first round of the vaccination campaign will cover 650,000 people aged one year and older . A second round will target 250,000 children aged between one and five with an additional dose for extra protection .',\n",
       " 'EAST CHICAGO , Ind . - The head of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) toured his first hazardous waste site on Tuesday amid proposed budget cuts that could devastate efforts to clean up contaminated land and water around the country . Scott Pruitt ’ s visit to East Chicago , Indiana , came a day after the agency denied a report that it was considering closing its Chicago office , which oversees regional environmental protection efforts , including the Flint , Michigan drinking water clean-up and Great Lakes restoration . “ The reason I ’ m here is because it is important that we restore confidence to the people here in this community that we are going to get it right going forward , ” Pruitt told the media after meeting with residents and lawmakers . Pruitt did not address the report of the possible office closure or how drastic budget cuts would impact the EPA ’ s operations . He toured a housing complex built on the Superfund site where around 1,000 residents had to leave their homes earlier this year due to lead contamination . Dozens of people held signs on Wednesday urging the EPA to continue clean-up efforts . The Superfund program was started in 1980 to clean up hazardous waste sites , which now number just over 1,300 around the country . The White House budget proposal submitted to Congress last month includes a 31 percent cut in spending for the EPA , including a similar reduction of the agency ’ s Hazardous Substance Superfund Account by $ 330 million to $ 762 million . Clean-up would continue in East Chicago , lawmakers said . Pruitt , “ made commitments that we would have it right , ” Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly said. ” There is a budget that is sent over and then there is a real budget that is put together . And the real budget will provide the funds necessary to make sure East Chicago is right. ” East Chicago , around 25 miles ( 40 km ) outside of Chicago , was home to the now defunct U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery Inc which contaminated the facility and surrounding areas with lead and arsenic . Demetra Turner , 44 , a resident of the West Calumet Housing Complex who has yet to leave , urged others to keep pressure on the EPA . “ Keep fighting people , keep fighting , because that is what it takes , ” she said .',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were convicted on Friday for their roles in the “ Bridgegate ” lane closure scandal , following a six-week trial that served to further tarnish the Republican ’ s damaged reputation . Bridget Kelly , the governor ’ s former deputy chief of staff , and Bill Baroni , former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , were found guilty in Newark federal court on all counts . They were convicted of fraud , conspiracy and depriving the residents of Fort Lee , New Jersey , of their civil rights . Christie , who is in charge of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’ s transition team , has not been criminally charged , but the scandal has torpedoed what was once seen as a promising political career . Christie on Friday again denied having had any advance knowledge of the scheme to choke traffic heading for the busy George Washington Bridge , which links New Jersey and Manhattan . “ I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments , and had no role in authorizing them , ” Christie said in a statement following the verdict . “ Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue. ” The scandal has dogged Christie , once seen as a potential presidential nominee before his campaign for the White House failed this year . Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign chairman John Podesta said on Friday Trump should ask Christie to resign as head of his transition team . Legal experts have said it is unlikely Christie would face any criminal consequences based on the trial testimony . Baroni and Kelly were accused of shutting down access lanes to the bridge in September 2013 in Fort Lee , New Jersey , creating a massive days-long traffic jam to punish the town ’ s mayor , Mark Sokolich , a Democrat , for declining to endorse Christie ’ s reelection campaign . The Port Authority , which runs the bridge , says it is the world ’ s busiest , carrying 102 million vehicles a year on the I-95 interstate highway , a major east coast traffic artery . Lawyers for Kelly and Baroni vowed to appeal . “ This is not over , ” Kelly ’ s lawyer Michael Critchley said outside the courthouse , with his arm around his weeping client . He said the judge had erred during jury instructions . Defense lawyers were furious when U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors in response to a question they could convict Kelly and Baroni on conspiracy even if the act itself was not “ intentionally punitive toward Mayor Sokolich. ” Wigenton said prosecutors did not have to prove motive , even though their case had revolved around the political retribution . “ By answering the way you ’ re answering , you ’ re directing a verdict of guilty , ” an angry Critchley told Wigenton on Tuesday . Baroni ’ s lawyer , Michael Baldassare , told reporters the case was a “ disgrace ” and said the conviction would be overturned . “ I am innocent of these charges , ” a smiling Baroni said . Kelly and Baroni ’ s co-conspirator , former Port Authority official and confessed mastermind David Wildstein , had earlier pleaded guilty and appeared as the government ’ s star witness , detailing how the three schemed to pay back Sokolich . But Wildstein also implicated Christie , saying he and Baroni discussed the lane closures with the governor while they were ongoing . Christie , Wildstein testified , laughed at the notion that Sokolich was frustrated by the traffic . At the time , Christie believed that securing the backing of Democratic officials would burnish his national reputation , according to trial testimony . Kelly , who took the stand in her defense , testified she had discussed the lane closures with Christie a month beforehand , though she said she thought at the time they were part of a legitimate traffic study . “ I take no pleasure in this verdict , ” said U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Paul Fishman , a successor of Christie in that position . Fishman , whose office prosecuted the case , said he was saddened by the conduct of top government officials . Kelly and Baroni ’ s lawyers argued that Wildstein had orchestrated the plot himself and told them he was conducting a traffic study . Wildstein said on the stand the three of them knew all along that the study was a bogus cover story . Prosecutors showed jurors numerous exchanges that Kelly and Baroni each had with Wildstein , who operated as liaison between Baroni at the Port Authority and Kelly in the governor ’ s office . Those included Kelly ’ s now-infamous email to Wildstein that prosecutors said launched the scheme , in which she wrote , “ Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. ” Kelly and Baroni are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21 . Each faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the most serious charge of fraud , though it is unlikely they would receive such a lengthy term .',\n",
       " \"MEXICO CITY - Mexico ’ s president has said his country will not pay for White House hopeful Donald Trump ’ s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border , and likened his “ strident tone ” to the ascent of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini . President Enrique Pena Nieto ’ s comments , published in Monday ’ s Excelsior newspaper , were among the most critical public comments yet by a foreign leader of the New York billionaire . READ MORE : Diplomats sound alarm bells over 'President Trump ' Trump , front-runner to win the Republican Party presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election , has sparked outrage in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs , and to make Mexico pay for it . Asked by Excelsior whether there was a “ scenario ” under which Mexico would pay if Trump won the presidency , Pena Nieto was clear . “ There is no scenario , ” he said . “ I have to say that I regret ( the plan ) , and of course , I can ’ t agree with this American politician ’ s position. ” Trump , who has also aroused concern among many in his own party with his proposals , has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the border and vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards to help make Mexico pay for the wall . Pena Nieto attacked the “ populism ” of the Trump campaign , which he said sought to put forward “ very easy , simple solutions to problems that are obviously not that easy to solve. ” “ And there have been episodes in human history , unfortunately , where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity , ” the Mexican president added . “ That ’ s how Mussolini got in , that ’ s how Hitler got in , they took advantage of a situation , a problem perhaps , which humanity was going through at the time , after an economic crisis . “ And I think what ( they ) put forward ended up at what we know today from history , in global conflagration . We don ’ t want that happening anywhere in the world , ” Pena Nieto said . Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray called Trump ’ s wall a “ terrible ” idea in an interview last week , while former Mexican presidents Felipe Calderon and Vicente Fox have both compared Trump to Hitler . In spite of his comments , Pena Nieto stressed that his administration will seek to reach agreement and maintain a respectful relationship with whoever wins the U.S. presidency . Foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S. government officials about what they say are Trump ’ s inflammatory and insulting public statements .\",\n",
       " 'MUMBAI - For Grishma , an Indian software designer , President Donald Trump ’ s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time . Fresh from gaining a master ’ s degree in Europe , and with an offer of employment from a well-known U.S. design firm , she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers - a dream job in America . But as she waits in the H-1B visa queue for the green light , she is caught in a bind . “ It ’ s a weird time to be applying , with all the scrutiny , ” said Grishma , who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardizing her chances of getting a visa . The United States has already suspended the “ expedited processing option ” for applicants , under which she may have received a visa in weeks . More broadly , uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her . She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate , but having accepted the U.S. job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere , including in Europe . “ It ’ s pretty debilitating , ” Grishma told Reuters . “ I ’ d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage. ” Trump ’ s decision was not a huge surprise , given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first . But the executive order he signed , though vague in many areas , has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans . Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty . The concerns are particularly acute in India , where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services , Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme , using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States , their largest overseas market . Experts say Trump ’ s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS , Infosys and Wipro , which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H-1B visas , roughly equivalent to the number of H-1B visas the United States issues in total each year . Two industry sources said Infosys , India ’ s No . 2 information technology ( IT ) services company , is applying for just under 1,000 H-1B visas this year , which one of the sources said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015 . It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trump ’ s presidency , although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on “ fly-in ” staff . TCS , Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H-1B visas they had applied for this year . With fewer visas going to Infosys , more might become available for smaller IT companies and big U.S. tech companies , like Facebook and Microsoft Corp , that typically send in fewer H-1B applications each year . U.S.-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam , managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms , said clients had been in contact seeking clarity , while the number of visa applicants had fallen . “ I think the reason for that is they get the sense that it ’ s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money , ” he said . “ There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming , and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business. ” Bashyam said the number of people on H-1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen . An engineer working at Cisco , who has been in the United States since 2011 , said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India . But the review of the visa system , and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa , could force him to change his mind . “ If that happens , then I would definitely be interested in going back to India . Even though I ’ m secure , I don ’ t want to be in a situation where my wife can not work , ” said the engineer , who declined to be named . “ Those who have heavily invested here , who ’ ve bought houses , property and are still on visas , are afraid. ” According to Bashyam , some Indians on H-1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States . “ With everything that ’ s going on , traveling outside the U.S. is the biggest fear for a lot of the H-1B workers working in the IT staffing industry , ” he said . And the uncertainty is not limited to IT . Trump ’ s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States , which typically draws in over 100,000 Indian students annually . One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250 percent since Trump ’ s election win in November . Akshay Baliga , a management consultant with a H-1B visa that is valid until 2018 , said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon . “ As a professional I ’ m looking eastward , ” said Baliga , now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America .',\n",

       " 'MADRID - A Spanish audit office has demanded the former leader of Catalonia and other politicians from the region pay 5 million euros ( $ 5.96 million ) for holding a consultative independence ballot in 2014 , El Pais newspaper said on Tuesday . The report , which cited judicial sources , came a day before Catalonia is expected to approve plans to hold an Oct. 1 referendum on a split from Spain . The 2014 vote was non-binding , a symbolic ballot by pro-independence campaigners that was declared illegal by Spain s Constitutional Court . Catalonia , along with Britain s Scotland and Belgium s Flanders , has one of the most active independence movements in the European Union . El Pais said the former head of the Catalan government , Artur Mas and other regional leaders , were being told by the audit body in charge of overseeing the financing of political parties and the public sector to pay out of their own pocket for organizing the consultation vote . The money was due by Sept 25 , it said . The audit office was not immediately available for comment . The current head of the Catalan government , Carles Puigdemont , said the move was the Spanish state spreading fear . Catalan lawmakers are due to vote on Wednesday on laws approving the referendum and the legal framework to set up an independent state . The laws are expected to be approved because pro-independence parties have a majority in the regional parliament . The populous , north-eastern region , with its capital Barcelona , has a strong national identity with its own language and traditions , although polls show support for self-rule waning as Spain s economy improves .',\n",

It s owned by an African American owner , but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it , Beasley told reporters .

       " 'Usually , men have all the advantages they make more than women , are automatically considered more competent ( whether or not this actually the case ) than women , have higher promotion prospects , can walk down a public street without worrying about random passersby sexually harassing them , don t have to worry about things being blamed on the way they were dressed at the time , and even can practice religion without the dogma of their faith placing them in subjugated roles . But one area in which men have more problems is the dating world.According to experts , men feel significantly more anxiety about dating than do women . But since Donald Trump is so awesome , YouTube prankster Ari Blau tried channeling the billionaire 2016 presidential candidate to see how much that helped ( hey , Trump says that everybody loves him , right ? ) . In short , it was as much a disaster as Trump s presidential campaign.Blau used actual Trump quotes while trying to score a date . When Mexico sends its people , they re not sending their best . They re not sending you . They re not sending you . They re sending people that have lots of problems , and they re bringing those problems to us , he tells one woman , who responded much in the same manner as the rest of the country when Trump initially made those remarks . I m just saying we need to build a wall . That one got him slapped.Blau told a Muslim woman he is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on . When she pointed out that he said he doesn t like Muslims , he informed her that she and her friend look like nice ones . Surprisingly , neither of them were interested in hanging out after those remarks.Another woman walked away when he assured her that his hair is real and offered to allow her to feel it , while he elicited a What the fuck ? response from an African-American lady who had just been informed thatBlau doesn t like black people counting his money ( he d prefer a Jewish guy ) . Another African-American woman who had just been informed that Barack Obama s birth certificate is a scam told Blau exactly what America has been telling Trump for years : You seem like a terrible person . Tell me about it . He was emulating one of the worst people.Interesting , one of Blau s colleagues , Vanessa Elgrichi , had much better success in getting some digits while dropping Hillary Clinton quotes on guys , even when she literally barked like a dog ( yes , Clinton did that ) for about 10 seconds and paraphrased the plotline of right-wing cinema treasure , 13 Hours : The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi ( technically not a quote , but it was funny ) .Guys just don t give a f * ck . You can see that happen below : No word on the effectiveness of Bernie Sanders quotes yet.Featured Image via screengrab',\n",
       " \"Senator John McCain just couldn t help himself . While millions of Americans were praying for his recovery , after he was diagnosed with brain cancer earlier this week , McCain took to Twitter to admonish President Trump over his decision to end a failed program that was supposed to train , fund and arm Syrians to fight Assad and ISIS.The program has been a complete failure and cost Americans millions of dollars.The Hill In February , 2012 , Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , who both serve on the Senate Armed Services committee urged that the United States arm opposition forces in Syria . War-hawks McCain and Graham argued that arming rebel fighters in the country could help beat back a Syrian government with close ties to Iran . Breaking Syria apart from Iran could be as important to containing a nuclear Iran as sanctions , Graham said at a press conference in Kabul , according to the New York Times . If the Syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the Iranians , the world is a better place . Where have we heard that strategy before ? Oh yeah in Libya and in Iraq . How did that work out for America and for the Middle East John ? McCain was apparently well enough by yesterday to warn tweeted his sparring partners in Congress that he d be back soon and told them to stand-by ! Goodness knows , America couldn t survive without the votes and guidance of Trump-hater and leader of the Republican we don t have to do what the American voters elected us to do opposition party.I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress , I 'll be back soon , so stand-by ! John McCain ( @ SenJohnMcCain ) July 20 , 2017Only one hour later , war-hawk McCain fired back with another tweet admonishing President Trump for ending the failed program created to assist the Syrian opposition . McCain accused President Trump of caving to Russia ( proving once again that McCain is anything but a team player when it comes to our president ) .Reports admin ending prgm to assist Syrian opposition irresponsible , short-sighted & plays into Russia , Assad 's hands https : //t.co/N7KVqn1VD6 John McCain ( @ SenJohnMcCain ) July 20 , 2017It s great to know that one of Trump s biggest opponents , who happens to also be a member of the same political party , isn t going to let a life-threatening diagnosis keep him from offering constant criticism of our president h/t Gateway Pundit\",\n",
       " 'COLOMBO - European lawmakers said on Thursday they were disappointed about Sri Lanka s slow roll-out of human rights reforms that the island nation had promised in exchange for trade concessions . The European Union reinstated concessions on a series of products in May - after Sri Lanka said it would ratify 27 international conventions on rights , labor conditions , the environment and governance . The island s key garments industry benefited the most from the duty reductions and other allowances offered by the EU s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus scheme . But a European Parliament delegation said they had seen little progress more than five months after the agreement . There was no immediate comment from the government . It was noted that a number of important issues remain pending , in particular the revision of the Prevention of Terrorism Act on which the Prime Minister and other senior figures had given their personal assurances , the EU delegation said in a statement . The United Nations has said Sri Lanka s current terrorism legislation allows the torture of detainees . Sri Lanka originally lost the EU concession in 2010 after then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa rejected demands from the international community to address human rights abuses allegedly committed during a 2009 offensive to crush a Tamil insurgency . Rajapaksa was ousted in January last year , and the EU agreed to reinstate the concessions after a new administration , led by President Maithripala Sirisena , promised to make changes . The garments industry is Sri Lanka s second biggest hard currency earner after remittances . It boasts annual exports of around $ 5 billion and produces goods for Victoria s Secret , Tommy Hilfiger , Nike , Marks & Spencer and other well known brands .',\n",
       " 'WARSAW - President Barack Obama pledged on Saturday to seek ways to calm racial tensions and reduce divisions between police and minorities during his final months in office , but he warned that easy access to guns nationwide exacerbated the problem . Obama spoke at the end of a week in which five policemen were killed by a sniper in Dallas and two black men were killed by police in Minnesota and Louisiana . He said he would bring together civil rights and law enforcement leaders for talks at the White House next week after returning from a trip to Europe . Obama , the first black U.S. president , has spoken out on racial issues throughout his time in the White House . He has also tried but failed to reform American gun laws , stymied by Republicans in Congress who have opposed any measures that they seen as impinging on the Constitutional right to bear arms , despite a series of mass shootings in recent years . Obama said the Dallas police force reduced murder rates and community complaints by taking the issue of race and police conduct seriously , and said he hoped that would inspire “ constructive actions ” in the coming weeks . “ That ’ s the spirit that we all need to embrace . That ’ s the spirit that I want to build on , ” he said during a press conference in Poland . But the divisive issue of gun control could not be separated from the tension between police and local citizens , he said . Obama noted that Dallas police on Thursday had to protect themselves and citizens from sniper fire while deciphering who had guns among those taking part in a protest decrying police shootings of black men . The presence of a gun in the car where Philando Castile , 32 , was killed by police in Minnesota on Wednesday contributed to that event , he said . “ In Minneapolis , we don ’ t know yet what happened , but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed , but it caused , in some fashion , those tragic events , ” Obama told reporters . “ We can ’ t just ignore that and pretend that that ’ s somehow political ... it is a contributing factor – not the sole factor – but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. ” Obama is very unlikely to succeed in reviving major gun control reform before he leaves office in January . Lawmakers in Congress have fought over three rival gun measures since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando . Democrats promised to put pressure on Republicans next week to win votes for measures to expand background checks and allow the Justice Department to block gun sales to people on government watch lists . Obama said on Saturday he hoped his legacy on the issue of race would be one of urging Americans to listen to each other and understand the country ’ s difficult relationship with race . “ The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn ’ t suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama , ” he said . He said he hoped his words as president had conveyed “ that things have gotten better , substantially better , but that we ’ ve still got a lot more work to do . ”',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says F. William Engdahl is a strategic risk consultant and lecturer , he holds a degree in politics from Princeton University and is a best-selling author on oil and geopolitics . Engdahl was a guest alongside Adam Garrie of The Duran on a power packed edition of The Sunday Wire with Patrick Henningsen entitled War And Peace . If you didn t get the chance to catch it , you can find that podcast here.More on this report from GlobalResearch ( Image TIME ) F. William Engdahl GlobalResearch The campaign promises were grandiose just like the candidate . Donald Trump wooed millions of American voters with his pledge to make America great again . He promised a $ 1 trillion infrastructure plan to revitalize the de facto depressed national economy . He promised to bring jobs back from China , Mexico and elsewhere by renegotiating major trade deals or scotching them entirely as with the Trans-Pacific Partnership of the Obama era , a scheme which Trump rightly said would take even more American jobs . After 100 days in office what are the prospects that his economic program will bring positive changes to Americans ? Dismal to put it mildly . Of course that should come as no shock to anyone taking a closer look at who is Trump , or more correctly his transition team brought in to run White House economic policy.That Dubious Wall Street Economics TeamThe top economic and financial position in the Trump Cabinet is held by of Steve Mnuchin , Secretary of the Treasury , a veteran Wall Street banker for 17 years at Goldman Sachs . As an undergraduate at Yale University , for those interested in occult matters , Mnuchin was inducted into the bizarre Skull & Bones secret society in 1985 , the same secret society where George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush were initiates.After leaving Goldman Sachs , Mnuchin was several times a business partner with notorious convicted hedge fund insider trader , George Soros , the putative Daddy Warbucks today of CIA and USAID regime change NGOs around the world . Both Mnuchin and Soros , with other investors , made a literal killing on the ravages of the US sub-prime real estate collapse . They bought bankrupt California mortgage lender IndyMac from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis at a bargain price . Mnuchin was severely criticized as owner and CEO of IndyMac for making money by foreclosing aggressively on homes at a rate double the norms of the banking industry . He was sued over questionable foreclosures , and settled several cases for millions of dollars . He violated the Fair Housing Act by not lending money to African Americans , Hispanics , and Asians . If we are to believe him , he told the financial TV CNBC last November it would be the Trump administration s job to make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs . A second key member of Donald Trump s economic team is Wilbur Ross , Secretary of Commerce . Ross , a billionaire , was for 24 years head of N.M. Rothschild & Sons New York office for bankruptcy-restructuring , a euphemism for what is called asset-stripping , where he earned the title , King of Bankruptcy . Ross ties to Trump go back to the 1980 s when Ross helped Trump avoid foreclosure on The Donald s three Atlantic City gambling casinos . Ross International Coal Group owned a West Virginia coal mine where an explosion in 2006 killed 12 miners . It was later revealed by his former associates that Ross knew well that the mine was sub-standard in safety but did nothing to correct it . In 2014 Ross was named head or Grand Swipe of a secret Wall Street fraternity , Kappa Beta Phi , founded in 1929 just before the stock market crash , whose stated purpose is to keep alive the spirit of the good old days of 1928 29 . Michael Bloomberg , former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine , Laurence Fink CEO of the $ 4.5 trillion financial firm BlackRock , are some of the very select members of Ross Wall Street fraternity.The Trump Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , responsible for drafting the President s annual Budget , is former US Congressman Mike Mulvaney . In his first Trump Budget proposal Mulvaney cut funds for a program Meals on Wheels which brings food to disabled , claiming the program showed no results . The program delivers meals to individual homes and senior citizen centers , feeding more than 2.4 million Americans 60 and older , more than half a million of them veterans according to their website . The government says that most recipients live alone , take more than six medications , and rely on these meals for at least half the food they consume.Gary Cohn is the White House Director of the National Economic Council . He came to the job directly from Goldman Sachs where he was President and Chief Operating Officer . Cohn led a Goldman Sachs delegation to Greece in 2009 to try to convince the Greek government to use derivatives to push debt due dates into the distant future . Goldman Sachs in fact , while Cohn held a top position in 2001 , devised the exotic derivatives scheme to hide billions in state debt from Brussels that enabled Greece to illegally qualify to join the Eurozone.This is the gang that we are supposed to believe will make America great again , and to make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs . In fact , based on what they have released to date , they will destroy much of what little remains of a functioning national economy and a stable middle-class .

       " '- Employees of U.S. companies seeking to avoid exposure to the Zika virus likely have few legal avenues to either refuse travel to affected areas or sue if they actually become sick from the virus . But it may be a different story if such workers subsequently give birth to Zika-infected babies . Since Zika was detected in Brazil last year , the mosquito-borne virus has spread to 33 countries , most of them in the Americas . The World Health Organization declared an international health emergency because of strong suspicions that infections in pregnant women may cause microcephaly , a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads and can suffer developmental problems . While the virus had typically caused mild symptoms in adults , it also has been linked to an autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome that can cause paralysis . U.S. and world health authorities are not currently warning against all travel to affected areas , as they did with the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa . They are , however , advising pregnant women to consider postponing travel , and all travelers to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites . Adherence to the recommendations of the U.S. Department of State or the World Health Organization would shield companies to a large degree from claims they acted recklessly in sending employees into Zika-affected areas , lawyers who typically represent employers say . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) further recommends that travelers wear insect repellent and sleep with mosquito nets in places where they might be bitten , among other measures . “ Your defense to any sort of claim is that you follow the public health guidance , ” said Mark Lies , a lawyer with the firm Seyfarth Shaw , which specializes in advising companies on employment issues . Such advisories also mean workers probably would not be protected from termination if they refuse to go to an affected area , lawyers said . While the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act gives workers the right to refuse dangerous tasks , those tasks must pose an immediate risk of death or serious injury . Something like working with a “ defective tool that has electrical sparks coming out of it ” would meet that standard , said Ben Huggett of Littler , another employment law firm . Traveling to a Zika-affected area , on the other hand , would probably not , he said . Lies said upgraded warnings in the event Zika proves more lethal or virulent could give workers more of a right to refuse travel . But he said OSHA affords no special protection for pregnant women under current threat levels . The law governs only the safety of employees , not any unborn children they may be carrying . If employees contract Zika while traveling on the job , any immediate harm they suffer would be covered by worker ’ s compensation insurance , a form of no-fault insurance that applies to injuries suffered on the job . Virtually all states require employers to obtain worker ’ s compensation insurance and mandate that it be the sole remedy for workplace injuries . Worker ’ s compensation covers lost wages and medical care but awards are typically smaller than private lawsuits , which can seek to recover damages for pain and suffering , as well as punitive damages for negligence . Whether worker ’ s compensation would cover any purported Zika-related injuries in an employee ’ s baby is less clear . Huggett said that a fetal injury might be covered as being derivative of the mother ’ s injury . Huggett said he was unaware of any case that directly addressed worker ’ s compensation for a fetus harmed by an infectious disease . “ It ’ s really an open question , ” he said . Lies said he did not believe worker ’ s compensation would generally cover injury to a fetus but thought it could open the door for an employee to bring a lawsuit against her employer for negligence . “ If someone is pregnant , or trying to get pregnant , or could get pregnant , you could have a case , ” said Katherine Dudley Helms , a lawyer with employment law firm Ogletree Deakins . Many states limit worker ’ s compensation to several years ’ pay , while a damage award for a severely impaired child could reach tens of millions of dollars , according to Michael Jones , an employment lawyer with Reed Smith . Michael Gerson of California firm Boxer & Gerson , who brings claims on behalf of employees , said such a case would still be a challenge if the company followed official warnings . The evidence would have to show “ that the mother was never given adequate warning to protect herself as she was going into this type of environment , ” he said . But Jones said such cases would be tough for the employer too . “ I would be concerned if I sent an employee to a high risk region , ” he said . “ If that claim gets in front of a jury , you ’ re going to be looking at a very sympathetic plaintiff. ” reported last week that several international airlines are allowing flight crew members who are or may become pregnant to request reassignment to routes that avoid Zika-affected areas . A spokeswoman for one of the airlines , American ( AAL.O ) , declined to comment on possible legal liability requiring such travel could have created , saying the company ’ s policy was motivated by concern for employees ’ well-being . United ( UAL.N ) and Delta ( DAL.N ) , which have also offered to reassign their employees , could not immediately be reached .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Donald Trump ’ s campaign paid $ 50,000 to the law office now representing Donald Trump Jr. a little more than a week before news surfaced of an unreported meeting with a Russian attorney that has prompted new accusations of collusion . The payment to the Law Offices of Alan S. Futerfas , dated June 27 , was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday . It was described as covering “ legal consulting ” fees . Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York City during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his father ’ s rival , Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . The payment was made to Futerfas ’ firm days before the story about the meeting broke , which caused a scramble inside the White House and Trump Tower to contain it . The disclosures do not say who Futerfas was hired to represent . Spokesmen for Trump ’ s re-election campaign and Futerfas did not respond to requests for comment . Futerfas was revealed as Trump Jr. ’ s lawyer on Monday after a New York Times report detailed meetings between the president ’ s eldest son and the Russian lawyer . Futerfas has not said when he was hired . Separately , the campaign also paid more than $ 538,000 to Jones Day , the law firm that represented Trump ’ s campaign during the election . The campaign also paid $ 89,561 for “ legal consulting ” to The Trump Corporation , which is owned by the president . The payment was dated June 30th . A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , as well as potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign . Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion . The Federal Election Commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate . Trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser , Marc Kasowitz , as outside counsel . His campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to Kasowitz . The White House confirmed in a statement on Saturday that veteran Washington attorney Ty Cobb will serve as special counsel , and sources familiar with the hiring said Cobb would handle the White House ’ s response to the Russia-related investigations . Cobb , a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells , is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress , as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue . In the second quarter of 2017 , Trump ’ s re-election campaign raised about $ 8 million and spent $ 4.4 million , according to Saturday ’ s disclosures . Much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of “ small dollar ” donations , classed as donations of less than $ 250 . Trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small-dollar donors as proof of his widespread support . Trump filed for re-election the day after taking office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office .',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Garner has not given up on Donald Trump s Washington.The 44-year-old actress spent the weekend lobbying the town s pillars of power to support early education for poor rural children . She spent Friday on Capitol Hill meeting dozens of top staff members . On Saturday , she delivered the keynote address before the annual National Governors Association winter meeting here . A potential sit-down with Ivanka Trump , who is advocating for more funding for child care , fell apart because of scheduling conflicts , but Garner remained optimistic about a face-to-face discussion soon.Other Hollywood liberals have shunned the new commander in chief notably during Sunday s Academy Awards ceremony , when many jokes were told at President Trump s expense . But Garner , a true-blue Democrat who campaigned for Hillary Clinton last year and held a fundraiser for Barack Obama in 2008 , is taking a unique approach : pushing a cause that would benefit the new administration s political base.The West Virginia native has long worked to bring assistance to poor , rural communities in desperate need of it . She has no plans to change that just because most of those communities went big for Trump in last year s election . In fact , she sees an opportunity to hold the president accountable for the pledges he made to the country s rural working class.While other celebrities merely attach their names to charities to promote themselves , actress Jennifer Garner is actually very involved in helping poor children in her home state of West Virginia.According to a study by British academics , when celebrities lend their names to a good cause , they are usually the main beneficiaries I m looking forward to helping him make good on what they saw as promises , a mandate from him , that he was going to make their lives better , Garner said in a 45-minute interview with The Washington Post.That makes Trump s presidency a psychological test of sorts for some members of the Hollywood elite , who can either demonstrate their true commitment to the causes they push or expose their charity work here as more about bolstering themselves.Very much in the former camp , Garner acknowledged that some of her friends want to turn their back to this administration . . . [ and ] just wouldn t even want to engage . Not her . If he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected , then let s do it . They certainly think he s going to , she said.She grew up solidly middle class , but she knew plenty of poor children who started elementary school behind and never caught up . They lived in the same sort of communities that Robert F. Kennedy , Shriver s uncle , visited in the mid-1960s along the Mississippi Delta , shaping the ideas of his 1968 presidential campaign.Garner returned home to West Virginia last year to help raise money after devastating flooding in the state . Reliably Democratic during her childhood , West Virginia ended up giving Trump his largest margin of victory something she could see coming by talking to people in economically depressed areas . People felt like Trump really understood them , that he was going to come in and create jobs for them , she said . They felt like they needed something to just turn everything upside down . It s that level of despair that leaves Garner willing to deal with Trump when some of her friends want to offer nothing but resistance . She may even be willing to meet the president . Send me a ticket to Mar-a-Lago . I m ready to go down and have a steak and a good chat , she said , only half joking about the prospect . I really think it s great , if he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected . Washington PostWe applaud Garner for her courage and her true commitment to poor children in her home state of West Virginia.Watch this short clip explaining why Garner s so passionate about helping these kids in West Virginia :',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump ’ s national security adviser , Michael Flynn , resigned late on Monday after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations . Flynn ’ s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took power on Jan. 20 . Flynn ’ s departure was a sobering development in Trump ’ s young presidency , a 24-day period during which his White House has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas . The departure could slow Trump ’ s bid to warm up relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Flynn submitted his resignation hours after Trump , through a spokesman , pointedly declined to publicly back Flynn , saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to Pence . Flynn had promised Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians , but transcripts of intercepted communications , described by U.S. officials , showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador . Such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy , known as the Logan Act . Pence had defended Flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled . “ Unfortunately , because of the fast pace of events , I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador . I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president , and they have accepted my apology , ” Flynn said in his resignation letter . Retired General Keith Kellogg , who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council , was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position . Kellogg , retired General David Petraeus , a former CIA director , and Robert Harward , a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command , are under consideration for the position , a White House official said . Harward was described by officials as the leading candidate . A U.S. official confirmed a Washington Post report that Sally Yates , the then-acting U.S. attorney general , told the White House late last month that she believed Flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador . She said Flynn might have put himself in a compromising position , possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail , the official said . Yates was later fired for opposing Trump ’ s temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly Muslim nations . A U.S. official , describing the intercepted communications , said Flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions . But he did indicate that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama on Russia for its Ukraine incursion “ would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia , ” the official said . Flynn , a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general , was an early supporter of Trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in Washington . He frequently raised eyebrows among Washington ’ s foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade Trump to warm up U.S. relations with Russia . A U.S. official said Flynn ’ s departure , coupled with Russia ’ s aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia , removes Trump ’ s most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward Putin . Flynn ’ s leaving “ may make a significant course change less likely , at least any time soon , ” the official said . Another official said Flynn ’ s departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries , including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . However , the second official said , Flynn ’ s exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller , whom he described as already having the president ’ s ear . Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the developments surrounding Flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened . “ We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening , ” said Democratic representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland . U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California , ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said Flynn ’ s departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the Russians . “ The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn ’ s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials , or with their knowledge , ” Schiff said . The committee ’ s chairman , Republican Devin Nunes , thanked Flynn for his service . “ Washington D.C. can be a rough town for honorable people , and Flynn — who has always been a soldier , not a politician —deserves America ’ s gratitude and respect , ” he said .',\n",

       " 'When then-President Elect Donald Trump held a press conference on January 11 to separate himself from his business ventures , he said , These papers are just some of the many documents I ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons , while standing next to a table stacked with manila folders . Sure , the papers all looked blank and the media wasn t allowed to examine them , but his intentions were clear . They are not going to discuss [ the business ] with me , Trump said of his sons . Again , I don t have to do this . They re not going to discuss it with me . Of course , few believed a word of it for even a second . Why should they ? A shrewd , dishonest businessman who puts wealth , status and power over everything was weeks away from being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America.Once again , the doubters have been proven right . Quite a few of them were republicans who truly didn t care or see a conflict of interests as they wanted a businessman in the White House anyway , but the thin veneer separating Trump s presidency and his business interests is rapidly starting to crumble.President Trump s two oldest sons , Donald Jr. and Eric , took to the morning show circuit this week to promote the latest budget accommodation in the Trump Hotels line , but that didn t stop them from weighing in on issues surrounding their father s presidency . While appearing on Good Morning America on Tuesday morning , Eric Trump described the Russian probe as the greatest hoax of all time , while his brother , Donald Jr. , had some strong words for London Mayor Sadiq Khan , saying that , Maybe he should do something to fix the problem rather than just sit there and pretend there isn t one . Just like their father , the pair also found time to bash the media.The unsettling news is that , although the pair aren t technically breaking any laws , they are setting a new , unchartered precedent for future American leaders . It s hard to describe what they re doing in polite words , said Mark Foster , a lawyer who specializes in ethics at the firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP . If he and this is a loaded term if he gets away with it , then obviously he sets a new standard for future presidents : It s OK to do this , which I think would be extremely regrettable because it s never been the standard and it ought not to be the standard , Foster continued . But if he does it and gets away with it , then , you know , what president down the road is gon na feel constrained not to set his own standards ? There are no standards . In an interview with Forbes magazine , Eric Trump claimed that he doesn t talk politics with his father . There is kind of a clear separation of church and state that we maintain , and I am deadly serious about that exercise , he said . I do not talk about the government with him , and he does not talk about the business with us . That s kind of a steadfast pact we made , and it s something that we honor . However , just like his father , it didn t take long for Eric to contradict himself , when he admitted just minutes later that he gives the president business updates . Yeah , on the bottom line , profitability reports and stuff like that , but you know , that s about it , he said , adding when asked how often , Yeah , probably quarterly . Funny , only one quarter has passed since Trump was sworn in as president and what reason do we have to believe a son who is this close to his father ? My father and I are very close , Eric Trump says . I talk to him a lot . We re pretty inseparable . This latest disclosure from Trump s son that he s talking about these things is confirmation that the attestations that the president made back in January regarding there being complete separation are a sham , said Alex Howard , deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation , a government accountability and transparency nonprofit . Look , I don t care what you say : Money influences the way you think , he said . You know , I tend to think favorably of my clients because they pay me a lot of money . That s not a bad thing . It s just human nature except if I were president of the United States , you wouldn t want people influencing my thinking by giving me money either directly or indirectly . You d rather I was thinking about the national interest . A spokesperson for the Trump Organization declined to comment , however , hopefully next time voters reconsider putting a businessman in the White House.Featured image via Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'CHICAGO - Illinois ended its historic budget drought on Thursday after the House of Representatives enacted the state ’ s first complete spending plan since 2015 by overriding the governor ’ s vetoes . But the $ 36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $ 5 billion tax hike may not save Illinois from becoming the first-ever U.S. state with a junk credit rating . The Democratic-controlled House mustered some Republican votes to enact a trio of budget and revenue bills into law over Republican Governor Bruce Rauner ’ s objection . The House ’ s action , which was delayed by a nearly two-hour lockdown of the state Capitol in Springfield after a woman threw a white powder into the governor ’ s office , followed successful Senate veto override votes on Tuesday . The spending plan for the fiscal year that began on July 1 ends an unprecedented two-year budget impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature . Rauner pointed to House Speaker Michael Madigan as the architect of the 32 percent permanent increase in the state ’ s personal income tax rate , which will rise to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent . “ His tax-and-spend plan is not balanced , does not cut enough spending or pay down enough debt , and does not help grow jobs or restore confidence in government , ” Rauner said in a statement , adding that Illinois “ desperately ” needs local property tax relief and term limits for elected officials . Madigan , who next month will becomes the longest-serving House speaker in U.S. history , said he acted in the state ’ s interest . “ The people in this chamber did not do what was easy today , but we did what was right for the future of our state , ” Madigan said after the House completed veto overrides of the budget and tax package , which ranks as one of the brightest legislative victories of his three decades as speaker . After the security scare , when a woman threw a white powder which was later determined to be harmless into the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor and the House gallery , the bipartisan turning back of Rauner ’ s budgetary vetoes came swiftly . For Rauner it was the most significant and humiliating political blow of his 30 months in office . Representative David Harris , who was among the 10 Republicans who voted to overturn the tax hike veto , rhetorically asked Rauner from the House floor how he willingly could take the state into the “ financial abyss ” considering the governor ’ s long-established business acumen as a former private equity investor . “ You are an astute , capable businessman . You understand what the numbers are here , ” Harris said . “ You understand the implications of junk-bond status . Is that what we want for the fifth-largest state in the union ? ” Rauner ’ s allies made an effort to defend the governor ’ s position to hold out for non-budgetary priorities like a property-tax freeze and changes in how injured workers are compensated by employers , but it was a lost cause . “ I hope that everybody back home and everybody across this state will rise up , let everyone in this chamber know exactly how they feel after this vote is taken , ” said Representative John Cabello , a Republican “ no ” vote . Illinois has been operating for two fiscal years on stop-gap budgets and spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law . Its unpaid bill backlog has ballooned to $ 15 billion , leaving state universities , social service and health care providers and scores of vendors starving for cash . Moody ’ s Investors Service , which rates Illinois one notch above junk , placed the state under review on Wednesday for a potential downgrade , saying the budget plan may fall short in addressing the state ’ s huge unfunded pension liability and the bill backlog . The new budget aims to initially reduce the bill pile by only about a third , while banking on a projected $ 1.5 billion in savings from creating a hybrid retirement plan for new hires and other pension measures . Praise for Thursday ’ s House action flooded in from cash-deprived social-service groups , including the Chicago-based Ounce of Prevention Fund , a group dedicated to fighting childhood poverty whose president is Diana Rauner , the governor ’ s wife . “ We applaud the members of the General Assembly in both parties who took the tough vote to try to end this impasse , ” the group said in a statement . With a new budget in hand , the Illinois Lottery will immediately seek leave to resume sales of Mega Millions and Powerball tickets after they were suspended in late June , and a shutdown of billions of dollars in state road projects will end , according to state spokespeople .',\n",

       " 'Despite Donald Trump s bravado and far too many in the mainstream media reporting on the hate and misogyny in his campaign as if it simply a normal presidential enterprise , there are some major problems on Team Trump.A new report from the New York Times finds all manner of dysfunction and infighting in Trump s campaign , which previous reports have noted simply didn t expect Republican opposition to give up the ghost like it did during the primaries.Among the weirder dysfunctional behavior : Trump staffers think they re being spied on.A sense of paranoia is growing among his campaign staff members , including some who have told associates they believe that their Trump Tower offices in New York may be bugged.This isn t out of nowhere . Trump has built the campaign , as the time terms it , around his unpredictable personality and the nearly a dozen Republicans inside and outside the operation told them the entire thing is a chaotic mess.Now , many Republican officials worry that Mr. Trump is uninterested in transitioning into his new role , including the rigors of going up against Mrs. Clinton in a general election fight.The Trump operation , for instance , has talked for weeks about hiring a full-time communications director , but has yet to bring anyone on board . Ms. Hicks is still the sole communications staff member ; the Clinton campaign , by contrast , has a press team of more than a dozen , including people devoted solely to the news media for black and Hispanic audiences.Even more troubling for Republicans , Trump has expressed disdain for a data-driven campaign , preferring instead to run as he did in the primaries , from one media-spectacle rally to the next . But general election voters are not primary voters . They will not be excited and engaged by the racist antics of Trump s anti-Latino , anti-Muslim , anti-woman crowds . In all likelihood they will be turned off by it.And in modern politics , as President Obama showed in spectacular fashion in 2012 , data drives campaigns . In addition to a polished campaigner like Obama , a candidate needs the nerds to mine the data , send out targeted messages , and get voters out to the polls . By all accounts , Hillary Clinton has done that , as the Democratic Party has continued to build on Obama s success.By contrast , Republicans in the swing states ( Florida , Ohio , etc . ) are now begging the national party for money and people while the Democrats and the Clinton campaign are already on a General Election footing.But Trump has his personal jet and his rallies , so he s happy.Featured image via Flickr',\n",

       " \"British pop singer Rebecca Ferguson , daughter of a white British woman and Jamaican father , says she has been invited to perform at Donald Trump s inauguration , but her response may not be the RSVP the President-elect s team were expecting.The former UK X-Factor runner-up said she would only accept the invitation on the condition that she could perform Strange Fruit a song protesting racism in 1930s America , made famous by Billie Holiday.The lyrics , written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol , were composed as a protest poem to highlight endemic racism in America s southern states.The song s opening lyrics deal with lynching , which was still happening in parts of the country at the time : Southern trees bear strange fruit // Blood on the leaves and blood at the root // Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze // Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.According to Billie Holiday s Estate , Holiday regularly performed the song at live performances in 1939 . Her record label , Columbia , refused to let her record the song under their name , so they granted her a one-session contractual release that gave Holiday clearance to independently record the track.Later that year , the album featuring Strange Fruit sold a million copies , becoming Holiday s biggest-selling record at the time . In 1978 , the single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . Last month , The Beach Boys told CNN that the group has been contacted about performing , but that no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate .

       " 'Republican front runner Donald Trump makes himself easy to hate . If he doesn t turn people off with his lack of policies , inexperience and complete lack of knowledge about how the world works , he ll steer Americans away with his racism , bigotry , misogyny and vulgar rhetoric . Most of the Republican party wants nothing to do with him , and Trump has been repeatedly called out by Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . Even President Barack Obama can t help but speak against the candidate . Now , Vice President Joe Biden has joined the conversation , stating that listening to Trump makes him sad . In an interview published on Wednesday , Billboard asked Biden how he felt about Trump by posing the question , Do you ever hear Donald Trump speak and think , Boy , I would love to debate that guy ? Biden replied : When I listen to some of the stuff Donald Trump says it just makes me sad . It s never , never been wise to try and appeal to the darker side of human nature . Abraham Lincoln was right it s about appealing to our better angels . That s who Americans are and that s what they want . Billboard s interview with the Vice President was focused around his legacy of ending violence against women and sexual assaults on school campuses around the country . Biden , who ( along with Obama ) has been heavily involved in initiatives to bring awareness around this cause ( such as the launch of the It s On Us campaign in 2014 ) , and said he found it disconcerting to see Trump encouraging his supporters to be aggressive . Of Trump s habit of egging violent behavior on , Biden said : It not only undermines the work that President Obama and I have done it undermines the work a majority of Republicans and Democrats have done . It is the antithesis of everything this country is about . Biden s remarks on violence against women couldn t be better timed , as Trump s supporters have just made headlines for groping and pepper spraying a 15-year-old girl at a rally in Wisconsin . Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was also arrested yesterday for physically assaulting a female reporter . They re obviously learning from the best Trump has made endless misogynistic attacks on women , and basically every minority in America.Biden has made his disapproval of Donald Trump known many times before . Last month , during an official visit to Mexico , Biden said that he almost felt obliged to apologize for Trump s anti-immigrant rhetoric , in which the front runner called immigrants rapists and drug dealers . At the American Israel Public Affairs Committee s policy conference earlier this month , Biden also took on Trump s anti-Israel comments and slammed the business mogul for targeting religious groups and minorities . He said : It is incumbent on all of us to stand up to those who would peddle in pernicious stereotypes , who seek to scare and divide us .

       " 'Sputnik Radio s new program Trend Storm is hosted by American geopolitical analyst and writer Andrew Korybko . This week , Andrew explores what s really driving the media uproar and political protests surrounding President Trump s executive order on immigration Andrew Korybko Trend StormUS President Donald Trump s controversial Executive Order to temporarily limit the entrance of select foreign nationals to the US is becoming a larger-than-life scandal of epic proportions.Following through on yet another of his campaign promises , America s new leader has banned people from seven countries from entering the US , building off of the list of supposedly terrorist-prone countries that his predecessor first identified . The immediacy of the order caught many people off guard , and there was confusion about whether it would apply to permanent residents ( green card-holders ) , already-vetted refugees , and individuals in transit . Almost immediately after the announcement was made last Friday , thousands of people across the US flocked to their local airports to protest the measure . In doing so , they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures , which during regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at locations considered essential to the nation s infrastructure.The protesters claimed that Trump had banned Muslims from entering the US , and the hashtag # MuslimBan instantly started trending on Twitter . In defense of the motion , Trump and his surrogates said that most majority-Muslim countries were untouched by the temporary border restrictions , pointing out that Indonesia the world s most populous Muslim country isn t on the list , for example . Moreover , in a cynical retort to the critics , they reminded the public that Obama had earlier suspended the US refugee program for Iraqi nationals for half a year back in 2011 , though no such protests erupted at that time . Nevertheless , it s hard for the Trump Administration to shake the social media stigma that this is a Muslim Ban , no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to nothing more than a brief review period for high-risk countries prior to the implementation of what s being called extreme vetting . This is because the mainstream US media is very sympathetic to what Trump and his spokespeople have termed the political opposition , namely , the Democratic Party.The perception management and narrative-building that these two institutions are known for was seen vividly and on full display during the presidential campaign , but it s gotten even more intense since Trump s election . Just like back then , however , it doesn t seem to be doing its intended job , since a poll released on Tuesday found that 49 % of Americans are in favor of the President s action , while 41 % are against it.Patrick Henningsen , Founder and Executive Editor of 21stCenturyWire.com and the host of the Sunday Wire Show , and Don DeBar , host of a syndicated daily radio newscast CPR News heard across the US , commented on the issue .

       " 'TUNIS - The bodies of 36 men found near the eastern Libyan town of al-Abyar in October appear to have been summarily executed by armed groups loyal to Khalifa Haftar s Libyan National Army ( LNA ) , Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday . Local police found the bodies on a main road about 50 km east of Benghazi in an area controlled by the LNA . Shortly afterwards , the LNA said it was launching an investigation . Libya is divided between rival governments and armed factions . The LNA controls most of the east , where Haftar has expanded his power over the past three years , waging a long campaign against Islamists and other opponents for control of Benghazi . Haftar s buy-in is seen as crucial for any effective political deal to unify the oil-rich North African country , and he has been increasingly courted by Western powers . The bodies found near al-Abyar were the latest in a number of such cases in eastern Libya . Relatives of six of the victims told HRW they had been seized from their homes on different dates by armed groups loyal to the LNA in Benghazi or other locations , the U.S.-based group said in statement . All the relatives said that the victims bore gunshot wounds and had their hands tied behind their backs , and that families had been prevented from putting up tents outside their houses in Benghazi to receive guests during a traditional three-day mourning period , HRW added . It cited a forensic investigator who reviewed pictures of 23 of the bodies as saying the injuries were consistent with executions at point-blank range . The Libyan National Army s pledges to conduct inquiries into repeated unlawful killings in areas under their control in eastern Libya have so far led nowhere , said Eric Goldstein , HRW s deputy Middle East and North Africa director . The LNA will be condoning apparent war crimes if their pledge to investigate the gruesome discovery in al-Abyar proves to be another empty promise . An LNA spokesman gave no immediate comment . The LNA has said it is investigating the commander of an elite forces unit who is sought by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for allegedly executing dozens of prisoners , though his exact whereabouts remain unclear .',\n",

       " 'We all remember when Justice Antonin Scalia died last year , leaving a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court . As a result of his death , President Barack Obama did his job and nominated a qualified federal judge to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court , Merrick Garland.Garland was a centrist , and a completely uncontroversial nominee for the land s highest court . However , Mitch McConnell decided that his goal was to obstruct President Obama , and he and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate decided not to meet with Judge Garland , and to give him no hearing and no vote . Now that we have a new president in Donald Trump , a right-wing extremist approved by far-right activist groups like the Heritage Foundation has been nominated in one Neil Gorsuch . To that end , Democrats are taking to the streets as they have been doing since Trump s election to pressure their elected Senators to oppose Trump s pick.One Democratic Senator , Jeff Merkley ( D-Oregon ) has said that he will defend and keep open the Supreme Court seat that was effectively stolen from President Obama . Merkley says via Twitter : Not only is this a stolen seat , but @ realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist . Unacceptable . https : //t.co/9bkw4QODXD pic.twitter.com/iVHDdb2Pn9 Senator Jeff Merkley ( @ SenJeffMerkley ) February 1 , 2017Part of the statement reads : This strategy of packing the court , if successful , could threaten fundamental rights in America , including workers right to organize , women s reproductive rights , and the rights of ordinary citizens to have their voices heard in elections rather than being drowned out by the corrupting influenceof dark money from the richest Americans . If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year , he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat . Garland is a centrist jurist who is respected on both sides of the aisle . Instead , he doubled down on division by picking an ideological and extreme nominee to satisfy the far right . Senator Merkley is right . The Court should not be packed with far-right or , for that matter , far-left- ideologues . It should be filled with thoughtful , intellectual jurists who will not let personal opinions supercede the rule of law . That means nothing to the GOP , though ; they just want their anti-worker , anti-poor , anti-gay , anti-immigrant , anti-woman agenda pushed through damage to the nation s highest court be damned.In short , Merkley is urging his Democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to stand up to Republican obstruction , to make them look as bad as possible , and to save the Court from far-right ideologues who would destroy and roll back rights for all Americans except the rich , straight , white , and male a century.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON/LONG BEACH , California - If Hillary Clinton ends up losing California to Bernie Sanders , it will be because of voters like Nallely Perez . Perez personifies what a Clinton supporter was supposed to look like : a 24-year-old Latina who grew up idolizing the former first lady as a groundbreaking woman in politics . But when she votes in California ’ s Democratic presidential nominating contest on Tuesday , Perez will be supporting Sanders . “ Everything that I would stand for , he has said it , ” said Perez , a student at California State University , Long Beach , who said she likes Sanders ’ promises of tuition-free college and universal healthcare . “ We found our voice in him. ” California is the final big contest in the long , bitter fight for the Democratic nomination . Opinion polls show the Democratic race there tightening in recent weeks . Where Clinton , a former secretary of state , once held a big lead over Sanders , a U.S. senator from Vermont , the two now are nearly tied . A University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll released on Friday showed Sanders with a one-percentage-point lead over Clinton in the state , 44 to 43 percent , a swing from March when Clinton held a nine-point edge . On the Republican side , Donald Trump has earned the nomination for the Nov. 8 election , and Clinton is close to capturing the number of delegates she needs to head the Democratic ticket . Her campaign expects that a win in New Jersey earlier on Tuesday will secure the nomination . But a loss in a populous Democratic stronghold like California could lend credence to Trump ’ s claim that she is a weakened candidate . “ Clinton would like to go to the nominating convention with the wind at her back and tamp down the perception that she doesn ’ t excite Democrats , ” said Rodell Mollineau , a Democratic strategist in Washington . A Sanders victory will not clear the way to his nomination unless it triggers a defection by scores of superdelegates - party office-holders and officials - from Clinton ’ s camp , an unlikely outcome . Sanders has vowed to use California as a springboard to the party convention in Philadelphia in July . A win , especially a big one , would validate the self-described democratic socialist ’ s decision to stay in the race to the end and give him leverage to influence Clinton ’ s policies and cabinet picks . “ The game he is playing is to be able to draw as many concessions as he can out of the party and the Clinton campaign , ” Mollineau said . The area around Long Beach , part of the 47th congressional district in California , has emerged as a key battleground . Sanders campaigned there a week ago ; Clinton was in the area on Friday and may return again before Tuesday ’ s vote . The district ’ s congressman , Representative Alan Lowenthal , remains one of the few uncommitted Democratic members of the House of Representatives to either Clinton or Sanders . His district once leaned Republican , but is becoming increasingly liberal thanks to an influx of Latino and Asian-American voters who comprise the majority of residents . The large minority population might be expected to translate into an advantage for Clinton , who has consistently shown strength with such groups . But a reporter who toured the area observed an abundance of Sanders supporters . In the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach , Sanders volunteers Gordon Winiemko and Jon Fellman manned a table on the sidewalk outside a coffeehouse . They had a long discussion with Shawn Coleman , a 24-year-old film student , who told them he preferred Sanders to Clinton because “ I think I ’ m a little bit more for what Bernie has in mind for the future , I think he ’ s right , and Hillary doesn ’ t really seem on it. ” Lia Roldan , a 42-year-old set decorator in the film industry who lives in Long Beach , said she was voting for Sanders because “ he has a lot of experience in standing up for causes that benefit the working class. ” Roldan said she would reluctantly support Clinton in a contest against Trump . “ I ’ ll vote for her only because I don ’ t want a Republican to win , but I don ’ t really feel in my heart that I would vote for her otherwise , ” she said . Stopping Trump was on the minds of those who said they would vote for Clinton on Tuesday . “ I love Bernie , ” said Sami Reed , 42 , the CEO of a corporate wellness business , interviewed in a thrift shop , “ but I ’ ll probably vote for Hillary just because I don ’ t want Trump to win. ” A second-term congressman , Lowenthal told he has come under a “ tremendous amount of grief and pressure from Sanders people ” to support him , but he would not say for whom he would vote . At California events , Clinton has been careful to focus her criticism on Trump , not Sanders , while talking up her national security experience . She will almost certainly need the support of passionate Sanders ’ backers to defeat the outspoken Trump in November .',\n",

Network security continued to slip after Kerry replaced Clinton in February 2013 , and remains substandard , according to the State Department inspector general.In each year from 2011 to 2014 , the State Department s poor cybersecurity was identified by the inspector general as a significant deficiency that put the department s information at risk .

       " 'DUBAI - An air strike by a Saudi-led military coalition killed 26 people at a hotel and an adjoining market in Yemen s northern Saadah province on Wednesday , according to medics and a witness . The attack , which struck the Sahar district of the vast territory that borders Saudi Arabia , demolished the budget hotel and reduced market stalls outside to a heap of twisted sheet metal . Medics retrieved corpses from the rubble . The military alliance led by Saudi Arabia has launched thousands of air strikes against Yemen s armed Houthi movement , which hails from Saadah and now controls much of the country . The coalition said in a statement carried on state news agency SPA that it was looking into media reports of the strike and would release its findings after a comprehensive review . The 2-1/2 year war effort has yet to achieve its goal of restoring to power the internationally recognized government , but the conflict has unleashed one of the world s worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people . Saudi Arabia and its allies , which receive logistical and intelligence help from the United States , accuse the Houthis of being a proxy of Iran . The Houthi group denies those charges and says it is conducting a patriotic resistance against outside aggressors in thrall to the West .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has given the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in Iraq and Syria that critics said allowed the White House to micro-manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscured the real number of U.S. forces . The Pentagon , which confirmed the move on Wednesday , said no change has yet been made to U.S. troop limits . It also stressed the U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria still was focused on backing local forces to fight Islamic State - a tactic that has averted the need for a major U.S. ground force . But the shift on troop limits was another sign of the greater authority Trump appears comfortable giving his military commanders to make battlefield decisions and could allow for more rapid increases in troop levels in the future . The Force Management Level system was introduced in Iraq and Syria during Barack Obama ’ s administration as a way to exert control over the military . Obama periodically raised FML limits to allow more troops in Iraq and Syria as the campaign against Islamic State advanced . But the numbers did not reflect the extent of the U.S. commitment on the ground since commanders found often less-than-ideal ways to work around the limits - sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors . The force management levels , which are officially at 5,262 in Iraq and 503 in Syria , are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of U.S. forces in both countries . Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Trump delegated authority to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to determine force management levels for Iraq and Syria going forward . “ We want our reporting to Congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood , ” White said in a statement , which was reported earlier on Wednesday by BuzzFeed News . “ We will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to Congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground . This is about transparency. ” Proponents within the U.S. military of changing the system also argue that bringing that decision-making authority to the Pentagon from the White House will allow more flexibility in responding to unforeseen developments on the battlefield . Replacing the force management level system with something more transparent could be a tricky task , not least because of political sensitivities about U.S. forces in Iraq . Influential Shi ’ ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr already has called on Iraq ’ s government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State is complete . The Iraqi and U.S. governments , however , have signaled the need for a continued U.S. military presence . How large that would be has yet to be determined . Too much information about the comings and goings of U.S. troops , particularly if announced in advance , could give information to enemy , experts say .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer called on Tuesday for an independent probe of what he called potential criminal violations surrounding the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn . Speaking to reporters in the U.S. Capitol , Schumer said law enforcement officers should question officials from President Donald Trump ’ s campaign , transition team and administration staff , including Trump himself , about events leading up to Flynn ’ s departure on Monday . He said Flynn , and potentially other Trump officials , could have violated federal prohibitions against citizens negotiating with foreign governments or receiving gifts and other benefits without authorization . “ What I am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions , ” Schumer said . “ There are potential violations of law here by General Flynn and potentially others. ” Flynn quit after only three weeks in the job , following disclosures that he discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Moscow ’ s ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations . Schumer appeared unlikely to win support for such a probe from his Senate Republican colleagues , who expect the scandal to be investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee . “ The Intelligence Committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election ... it ’ s highly likely they ’ d want to take a look at this episode . They have the jurisdiction to do it , ” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters separately . Schumer welcomed any involvement by the Senate committee but said the panel lacked the prosecutorial powers needed to hold potential wrongdoers fully accountable . He also said that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from any probe of Flynn ’ s resignation because of his political ties to Trump . Schumer said career Justice Department investigators or an independent counsel could look into whether other Trump team members had contact with Russia and why the White House did not seek Flynn ’ s resignation sooner . “ Any attempt to lie or mislead must be countered by the full force of the law , ” Schumer added . “ His resignation raises more questions than it answers . And the American people deserve to know the truth . ”',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday threw out the conviction of former New York state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos , citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that narrowed the conduct that can sustain federal corruption charges . But the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals said federal prosecutors can retry Skelos and his son , Adam Skelos , for bribery and fraud because the evidence presented at trial was “ sufficient ” to prove their case . The ruling came two months after the court also vacated the bribery conviction of former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver , employing similar reasoning . Acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Joon Kim said in a statement that his office would pursue a “ prompt retrial where we will have another opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence of Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos ’ guilt. ” Prosecutors previously said they would also retry Silver . Alexandra Shapiro , a lawyer for Skelos , said in an email : “ We believe that as events unfold it is going to become clear that this is a case that never should have been brought. ” The back-to-back convictions of Silver and Skelos , the state ’ s most powerful legislators , in November and December 2015 represented two of the most high-profile victories for former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara , who made public corruption a major focus during his tenure before he was fired by U.S. President Trump in March . Skelos , 69 , a Republican , was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2016 , while his son Adam was sentenced to 6-1/2 years . Both were free on bail at the time of Tuesday ’ s decision . Together with Governor Andrew Cuomo , Skelos and Silver were members of the “ three men in a room ” in the state capital of Albany that hold enormous sway over major legislation . The U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell , finding that routine acts such as setting up meetings or contacting other politicians did not qualify as “ official acts ” under federal bribery statutes . The 2nd Circuit said on Tuesday that the jury instructions at Skelos ’ trial , which occurred before the McDonnell decision , were therefore improper , through no fault of the judge or the prosecutors . The elder Skelos was found guilty of using his position as Senate majority leader to pressure three companies seeking his political support into paying his son , including for a lucrative “ no-show ” job . In exchange , Skelos pushed through bills to benefit the companies , according to prosecutors . The case is U.S. v. Skelos et al , 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , Nos . 16-1618 and 16-1697 .',\n",

A screen shot showing an advertisement for Kellogg s Frosted Mini Wheats was part of an online campaign to get marketers to abandon the site . We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company , said Kris Charles , a spokeswoman for Kellogg , which also makes Frosted Flakes and Special K cereal . We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com . We are working to remove our ads from that site . AppNexus Inc. , one of the biggest digital advertising services , barred Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools earlier this month because it felt the publisher violated its hate-speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after Bannon was given the White House post . The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence , according to a spokesman for the company . Kellogg declined to name the third-party company that places its digital ads.Kellogg is the latest major brand to pull its online advertising from the news site . Other companies including Allstate , Nest , EarthLink , Warby Parker and SoFi have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads , according to Digiday.The site had 19.2 million unique monthly U.S. visitors in October , up from 12.9 million a year ago , according to ComScore Inc. Breitbart doesn t rely on subscriptions , suggesting that advertising is a major source of revenue.Many marketers buy online advertising through third-party tech companies that distribute them widely across the internet , so they may not be aware of all the websites where they appear . But they also have the ability to control which websites display their ads . The creator of the Twitter account Sleeping Giants has been taking screen shots of ads appearing on Breitbart in an attempt to pressure those brands to take their ads down.Not all brands are shying away from advertising on Breitbart , though . After a screenshot showed a Nissan ad on the website , the automaker said in a statement that it places ads in a variety of sites in order to reach as many consumers as possible . The placement of Nissan advertising is not intended to be a political commentary and there are no plans to change the advertising mix at this time , the company said . Bloomberg',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek re-election to his U.S. Senate seat , he announced on Wednesday , reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him . The first-term Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating , but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House . “ But as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation , there ’ s another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come : The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president , ” Rubio said in a statement . The 45-year-old lawmaker , a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally , had been under intense pressure to run , especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive . Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election , as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate . He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race . President Barack Obama , a Democrat , took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney . This year , Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate , compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a “ terrific outcome ” if Rubio decided to run . Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama ’ s “ failed ” policies . But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also “ worrisome , ” citing Trump ’ s statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee ’ s positions on important issues are unknown . “ If he is elected , we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction , and if necessary , stand up to him , ” Rubio ’ s statement said . Still , he pledged to vote for Trump , a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment . “ It ’ s not the choice I wanted ... and it ’ s not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with , but it ’ s the choice we have , ” he told CNN in an interview . His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando , Florida , but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country , including the mass shooting . The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed . He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words . The Cook Political Report said Rubio ’ s announcement “ breathed new life ” into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up , citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator ’ s remarks during his presidential campaign that he was “ frustrated ” with the upper chamber . Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly , who had been seeking the Senate seat , opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week . After Wednesday ’ s announcement , Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera , a friend of Rubio , and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat . Other Republicans , however , have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida ’ s Aug. 30 primary . U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy , a leading Democratic challenger , accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents , and now “ treating them like a consolation prize . ”',\n",
       " 'EDINBURGH - Scotland s devolved government has recommended that its parliament at Holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw Britain from the European Union , on the grounds that it could water down their powers , a document filed by the Scottish government said on Tuesday . The approval of the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales does not represent a veto to the Brexit process , although it would stretch Britain s constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the UK government of Prime Minister Theresa May to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies . Scotland would work with the Welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which , if agreement were reached , would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies , the document said . The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones . Along with the Welsh government , the Scottish government can not recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted , the document filed with the Scottish parliament said . The Scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the EU should not be centralization of power in Whitehall and Westminster . However , that is what the bill proposes . Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been arguing that Brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement , which up to now has allowed assemblies in Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education . Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership in a June 2016 referendum while England and Wales voted to leave . It remains a matter of regret to the Scottish government that the UK plans to withdraw from the EU . The government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the EU , including preserving a functioning legal system , the document said . The Scottish government s key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the Scottish parliament and government ( ... ) and those on powers for UK and Scottish ministers to alter domestic law , it said . The Scottish and Welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the EU to the UK government will imply restrictions on the power of Scottish and Welsh chambers . But Britain s Scotland minister , David Mundell , has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power .',\n",

       " 'Republicans who call themselves pro-life are presenting a health care plan that would literally kill tens of thousands of people by implementing devastating cuts to Medicaid and Sister Simone Campbell , leader of the advocacy group Nuns on a Bus , is wondering how GOPers can give themselves that moniker while putting our most needy , including the elderly and children , at risk.Campbell called the Affordable Care Act a life-saving bill and in an op-ed for The Hill she said she wants to call their bluff on their proclaimed pro-life stance . I am outraged to see allegedly pro-life Republicans put forward a healthcare bill that will strip millions of people of their healthcare . Not only that , but this bill preys on the most vulnerable ! This is antithetical to any faith , she writes . The House and Senate healthcare proposals are the antithesis of a pro-life stance and needs to be named as such . People will lose their lives if this bill becomes law . Then the Sister hit Republicans where it hurts : with facts . It used to be very difficult for women to find insurance coverage for pre-natal and maternity care . Under current law , maternal health ( pregnancy and postpartum services ) is an essential benefit , which insurers must offer without charging extra , she continued . This is a pro-life benefit but the GOP is set to eliminate the essential health benefits , including maternity care , for millions of expecting mothers . Campbell noted that Trumpcare would bring us back to a time when maternity riders forced women to pay more than many could afford just to bring a child into the world . This is not pro-life . She pointed to the Republicans proposing to cut and cap Medicaid funding for people with disabilities and those living below the poverty level in our nation and she goes on to say that 45 percent of births in the United States are paid for by Medicaid ! Campbell writes that pro-life members of Congress are actually dismissing the needs of mothers and their newborn children . Supporting Medicaid funding is a pro-life stance , she says . Campbell also notes that Medicaid benefits senior citizens who live in nursing homes , including many Catholic Sisters who have served their entire lives tending to the most vulnerable . She points to Medicaid helping those with disabilities and says that Republican efforts to cut Medicaid funding arbitrarily will jeopardize their lives and wellbeing . Taking money away from seniors , people in poverty and people with disabilities is wrong , she writes . Everyone has a right to live in dignity . The Sister says Republicans are only concerned with lining the pockets of the wealthiest and are doing so at the expense of Medicaid and our most vulnerable people . Indeed , the cuts to Medicaid will afford the wealthy a nice tax break while lower-income Americans die and/or suffer . If Republicans are truly pro-life , she writes , then they will place people , not corporate interests , at the center of their decision-making . And , when people are healthier , we all do better . She called out her pro-life colleagues : So my pro-life colleagues : Listen up . To be pro-life requires us to care about ALL of life , not just birth or death . Mothers and their infants need medical coverage . The disabled and the elderly need the promise that they can live in dignity for their entire natural life . This means that we must not cap individual or state expenditures for Medicaid or remove services from the defined benefits . It also means that we must not block grant Medicaid to the states or institute a per capita cap.She concluded her op-ed by calling on Senators to reject Trump/Republicare and requested to have a real conversation that doesn t include 23 million Americans losing their healthcare . Amen , Sister ! Image via screen capture .',\n",

       " 'BEIJING - When Kim Jong Un inherited power in North Korea in late 2011 , then-Chinese president Hu Jintao was outwardly supportive of the untested young leader , predicting that traditional friendly cooperation between the countries would strengthen . Two years later , Kim ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song Thaek , the country s chief interlocutor with China and a relatively reform-minded official in the hermetic state . Since then , ties between the allies have deteriorated so sharply that some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become , like Washington , a target of its neighbor s ire . While the United States and its allies - and many people in China - believe Beijing should do more to rein in Pyongyang , the acceleration of North Korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two . Before retiring this summer , China s long-time point man on North Korea , Wu Dawei , had not visited the country for over a year . His replacement , Kong Xuanyou , has yet to visit and is still carrying out duties from his previous Asian role , traveling to Pakistan in mid-August , diplomats say . The notion that mighty China wields diplomatic control over impoverished North Korea is mistaken , said Jin Canrong , an international relations professor at Beijing s Renmin University . There has never existed a subordinate relationship between the two sides . Never . Especially after the end of the Cold War , the North Koreans fell into a difficult situation and could not get enough help from China , so they determined to help themselves . A famine in the mid-1990s that claimed anywhere from 200,000 to three million North Koreans was a turning point for the economy , forcing private trade on the collectivized state . That allowed the North a degree of independence from outside aid and gave credence to the official Juche ideology of self-reliance . China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War , in which Chinese leader Mao Zedong lost his eldest son , and Beijing has long been Pyongyang s chief ally and primary trade partner . While their relationship has always been clouded by suspicion and mistrust , China grudgingly tolerated North Korea s provocations as preferable to the alternatives : chaotic collapse that spills across their border , and a Korean peninsula under the domain of a U.S.-backed Seoul government . That is also the reason China is reluctant to exert its considerable economic clout , worried that measures as drastic as the energy embargo proposed this week by Washington could lead to the North s collapse . Instead , China repeatedly calls for calm , restraint and a negotiated solution . The North Korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in Pyongyang for comment by email , fax or phone . The North Korean embassy in Beijing was not immediately available for comment . China s foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment . It has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls the China responsibility theory and insists the direct parties - North Korea , South Korea and the United States - hold the key to resolving tensions . Until his death in 2011 , North Korean leader Kim Jong Il made numerous entreaties to ensure China would back his preferred son as successor . While then-President Hu reciprocated , the younger Kim , in his late 20s at the time , began to distance himself from his country s most powerful ally . There s a lot of domestic politics in North Korea where this young leader who isn t well-known , he s not proven yet , especially has to show that he s not in the pocket of Beijing , said John Delury of Seoul s Yonsei University . I think he made the decision first to keep Hu Jintao and then ( current President ) Xi Jinping really at bay . Within months of coming to power , Kim telegraphed North Korea s intentions by amending its constitution to proclaim itself a nuclear state . The execution of Jang in 2013 sealed Beijing s distrust of the young leader . Of course the Chinese were not happy , said a foreign diplomat in Beijing focused on North Korea . Executing your uncle , that s from the feudal ages . In an attempt to warm ties , Xi sent high-ranking Communist Party official Liu Yunshan to attend the North s October 2015 military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers Party of Korea . Liu hand-delivered a letter from Xi praising Kim s leadership and including congratulations not just from the Chinese Communist Party but Xi s personal cordial wishes in a powerful show of respect . Xi s overture has been repaid with increasingly brazen actions by Pyongyang , which many observers believe are timed for maximum embarrassment to Beijing . Sunday s nuclear test , for example , took place as China hosted a BRICS summit , while in May , the North launched a long-range missile just hours before the Belt and Road Forum , dedicated to Xi s signature foreign policy initiative . Mao Zedong s description of North Korea s relationship with China is typically mischaracterised as being as close as lips and teeth . His words are better translated as : If the lips are gone , the teeth will be cold , a reference to the strategic importance of the North as a geographical security buffer . Despite its resentment at the pressure North Korea s actions have put it under , Beijing refrains from taking too hard a line . It said little when Kim Jong Un s half-brother was assassinated in February at Kuala Lumpur s airport . The half-brother , Kim Jong Nam , had been seen as a potential rival for power in Pyongyang and had lived for years in Beijing , then Macau . An editorial in China s influential Global Times warned after Pyongyang s latest nuclear test that cutting off North Korea s oil would redirect the conflict to one between North Korea and China . Zhao Tong , a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing , said North Korea was deeply unhappy with China s backing of earlier UN sanctions . If China supports more radical economic sanctions that directly threaten the stability of the regime , then it is possible that North Korea becomes as hostile to China as to the United States .

       " 'Just before the Inauguration for the president-elect , a Russian metal working company has minted a sterling silver coin to commemorate Donald Trump s big day .

Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.Only 45 of the limited-edition coins have been made.Image : screen capture via Associated Press . The man in charge of Art-Grani , spoke with the the Associated Press Television News and said the coins were designed to express his and other Russian business leaders hopes associated with Trump . Vladimir Vasyukhin s company is about 650 miles east of Moscow , in south-central Russia s Chelyabinsk region . He said , there are more hopes associated with Trump with regards to the lifting of sanctions ; maybe the environment ( between the U.S. and Russia ) will change . CBS reports : Mr. Trump even suggested in an interview with the Times of London several days ago that he might be willing to drop some of the sanctions against Moscow in exchange for an agreement on nuclear arms reduction . Moscow s reaction to the proposal was muted , and on Tuesday , Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he didn t actually see it as a proposal from the incoming president.Five of the commemorative coins will be cast in silver and the others will be cast in gold.They measure almost five inches in diameter and weigh about two pounds each , similar to coins made by the company featuring Putin and other notable Russians.Watch : We re wondering when the president-elect s accent will start changing to Russian . Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who is very smart . Vasyukhin said the coins will sell for thousands of dollars and added that his company would like to give the first coin to Trump . Maybe Trump could use the coin to pay back some of the money he owes to Russian banks.Coincidentally , Ann Coulter authored a book titled , In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! We re told by Trump supporters that Donald will be tough on Russia . Is anyone else laughing , too ? Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'GENEVA - North Korea on Friday ruled out negotiations with Washington as long as joint U.S-South Korea military exercises continue , and said that Pyongyang s atomic weapons program would remain as a deterrent against a U.S. nuclear threat . In an interview with Reuters , Han Tae Song , North Korea s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva , brushed off the new sanctions which the Trump administration has said it is preparing , as well as the possibility of North Korea being added to a U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism . South Korea and the United States agreed on Friday to keep working for a peaceful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis , but a U.S. envoy said it was difficult to gauge the reclusive North s intentions as there has been no signal . Han , asked about those bilateral talks in Seoul , replied : As long as there is continuous hostile policy against my country by the U.S. and as long as there are continued war games at our doorstep , then there will not be negotiations . There are continued military exercises using nuclear assets as well as aircraft carriers , and strategic bombers and then ... raising such kinds of military exercises against my country , he said . He , who is ambassador to the U.N. s Conference on Disarmament , was speaking at the Democratic People s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) mission in Geneva , where the DPRK and the United States secured a 1994 nuclear deal which later fell apart . He said he had no information on when North Korea might test a ballistic missile again , after the last one two months ago . The DPRK , my country , will continue to build-up its self-defense capability , the pivot of which is nuclear forces and capability for a triumphant ... strike as long as U.S. and hostile forces keep up nuclear threat and blackmail , Han said . Our country plans ultimate completion of the nuclear force , he said . China said on Thursday that a dual suspension proposal to handle North Korea was still the best option , after U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a freeze for freeze agreement . Han , asked about China s latest appeal for a freeze , said the situation is far from those things . Han said that U.S. administrations had never accepted halting joint military exercises , adding : So if they accept such things , then we will think what we do in the future . North Korea could not consider abandoning its nuclear program , he said , adding : This is the deterrent , the nuclear deterrent to cope with the nuclear threat from America . Han said that Trump was expected to announce further sanctions against North Korea . Existing sanctions have constituted large-scale human rights violations that had delayed delivery of aid and consumer goods , he said . It is obvious that the aim of the sanctions is to overthrow the system of my country by isolating and stifling it and to intentionally bring about humanitarian disaster instead of preventing weapons development as claimed by the U.S. and its followers , he said . Han , asked whether new U.S. sanctions were expected against North Korean individuals or financial structures , said : The media is saying the Americans and Trump are considering such things . But that is their business and then we don t mind what they want to do against my country since the aim is quite clear . So we are ready for such kinds of measures taken by America against my country , he said .',\n",

       " 'RIYADH - Saudi air defenses shot down a ballistic missile fired by Yemen s Houthi group towards Riyadh on Tuesday , the Saudi-led coalition said , in an attack that could escalate a proxy war between the kingdom and Iran . There were no reports of casualties or damage . In contrast , a U.N. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 non-combatants in war-torn Yemen since Dec. 6 . The Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had aimed the missile at the Saudi royal court at al-Yamama palace , where a meeting of Saudi leaders was under way . It described the attack as a new chapter in the conflict . The Saudi-led coalition said the missile , the latest of several fired towards Riyadh , had been directed at residential areas and there had been no damage . Quoting a statement from the coalition , Saudi state news agency SPA said Iranian-made missiles were a threat to regional and international security . It accused the Houthis of using humanitarian entry points into Yemen to smuggle in missiles from Saudi Arabia s regional arch-foe Iran . Coalition forces confirm intercepting an Iranian-Houthi missile targeting ( the ) south of Riyadh . There are no reported casualties at this time , the government-run Center for International Communication wrote on its Twitter account . Saudi palaces , military and oil facilities are within range of such missiles , the Houthis said in a statement carried by the group s Al-Masirah television . The U.S. State Department condemned the missile attack and called on Iran to stop arming the Houthis . At the United Nations , U.S . Ambassador Nikki Haley said the Houthi missile strike bears all the hallmarks of previous attacks using Iranian-provided weapons . Haley said she was exploring , with some U.N. Security Council colleagues , several options for pressuring Iran to adjust their behavior . Haley is likely to struggle , however , to convince some members , like veto powers Russia and China , that U.N. action is needed . Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in struggle for influence in the Middle East . The conflict in Saudi Arabia s backyard Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced over 2 million . The Houthis for their part have fired several missiles at the kingdom , but have not caused any serious damage . The attack came as the Houthis marked 1,000 days since the Saudi-led coalition began military operations in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned group drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile . The enemies had their own mirage calculations ... but over 1,000 days , there has been this great steadfastness , said Abdel-Malek al-Houthi , a Houthi leader , in a speech on the group s Al-Masirah TV . The United Arab Emirates , a close ally of Saudi Arabia and part of its coalition , said the latest Houthi attack underscored the need to keep the military campaign in Yemen going . With every Iranian missile fired by the Houthi militia against civilian targets , the necessity of ( Operation ) Decisive Storm becomes clear , United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his Twitter account . Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri condemned the attack , saying such actions exacerbated divisions in the region . Saudi Arabia and Iran are also competing for influence in Iraq and Syria . witnesses described hearing a blast and said they saw smoke in the northeast of Riyadh . Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince , Mohammed bin Salman , has described what Riyadh says is Iran s supply of rockets to the Houthis as direct military aggression that could be an act of war . Iran has denied supplying such weaponry to the Houthis , who have taken over the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , and other parts of the country during its civil war . Saudi Arabia said on Nov. 4 it had intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh s King Khaled Airport , an attack that led the coalition to close Yemeni ports . On Nov. 30 , Saudi Arabia shot down another missile near its southwestern city of Khamis Mushait . Last week , the United States presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Houthis , describing them as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions . The arms included charred remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from Yemen in the Nov. 4 attack , as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in Yemen by the Saudis .',\n",
       " 'TOKYO - Emperor Akihito , who has spent much of his nearly three decades on Japan s throne seeking to soothe the wounds of World War Two , will step down on April 30 , 2019 - the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in about two centuries . A 10-member Imperial Household Council of lawmakers , royals and supreme court justices , chaired by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , agreed on the timing on Friday . Akihito , who turns 84 on Dec. 23 and has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer , said in rare remarks last year that he feared age might make it hard for him to fulfil his duties . He will be succeeded by his heir , 57-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito . This is the first abdication by an emperor in 200 years and the first under the ( post-war ) constitution , Abe told reporters after announcing the recommendation . I feel deep emotion that today , the opinion of the Imperial Household Council was smoothly decided and a big step was taken toward the imperial succession . The cabinet still has to sign off on the decision on the date , which it will likely do next week . Once considered divine , Japan s emperor is defined in the post-war constitution as a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people , but has no political power . Akihito , along with Empress Michiko , has spent much time trying to address the legacy of World War Two , which was fought in the name of his father Hirohito , and consoling victims of disasters or other woes . He is widely respected by average Japanese . Both the emperor and empress thought tirelessly about the people , said Taeko Ito , a 72-year-old caregiver . Now he is elderly and I wish from my heart that he can have a rest . Akihito and Michiko , the first commoner to wed a Japanese monarch , have worked to reconcile ties across Asia , soured by Japan s aggression before and during World War Two , with numerous visits abroad . In 1992 , he became the first Japanese monarch in living memory to visit China , where bitter memories of the war run deep . During that visit the emperor said he deeply deplored an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great suffering on the people of China . Akihito has consistently urged the Japanese never to forget the horrors of war , remarks that have garnered increased attention since Abe took office in 2012 and sought to adopt a less apologetic tone over Japan s past military aggression . He redefined the job . He wanted to modernise the monarchy and take care of the unfinished business ... and bring the imperial household closer to the people , said Jeffrey Kingston , director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan . He s been remarkably successful on all fronts . He is deeply admired and respected . His moral authority is unquestioned . Once Akihito steps down a new imperial era will begin , replacing the current Heisei or achieving peace period which began on Jan. 8 , 1989 , the day he took the throne . Japan uses the Western-style Gregorian calendar but has also preserved the ancient custom in which the reign of a new emperor ushers in a new era . The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817 . Post-war law had not allowed for abdication , so a one-off law was adopted in June to let Akihito step down , but it left details such as the timing to be worked out . An early proposal that he retire at the end of 2018 , his 30th year on the throne , was rejected over worries it would conflict with rituals and other duties around then . Another date considered was March 31 , 2019 , the end of the business year . But subsequent ceremonies would have coincided with a busy time for many people and nation-wide local elections in early April , Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said . Some Japanese lamented that the process was taking too long . It s the same for me - life is not so long , said a 79-year-old retiree , Asataro Nishizawa . They should have granted his wish sooner , while he is still vigorous . The abdication law did not address the problem of the future of an ageing , shrinking imperial family and the related issue of whether women should be allowed to ascend the throne . Eleven-year-old Prince Hisahito , the son of Akihito s younger son Prince Akishino , is the emperor s only grandson and will be second in line to the throne after his father following the abdication . Naruhito s daughter , Princess Aiko , who turned 16 on Friday , can not inherit the males-only throne .',\n",
       " 'LIMA - Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Wednesday signaled both his vice presidents would resign if Congress forced him from office , calling an opposition bid to remove him a coup attempt that had to be resisted . The rightwing populist party that controls Congress , Popular Force , aims to oust Kuczynski in a vote on Thursday on grounds he is morally unfit to govern , after finding he once had business connections with a company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal . Kuczynski , who denies anything improper or illegal , said Popular Force was misusing its majority to attempt a power grab . The constitution and democracy are under attack . We re facing a coup dressed in supposedly legitimate legal interpretations , he said in a late night speech on national television . This is a conviction that my two vice presidents share , because neither wants to be part of a government born of an unjust and anti-democratic maneuver , Kuczynski said . He was flanked by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra and Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz . If Kuczynski loses Thursday s congressional vote to remove him and his two vice presidents depart as well , new presidential and legislative elections would be called . A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker , Kuczynski has struggled to govern since winning last year s presidential election but only a small share of congressional seats for his center-right party . Popular Force says its efforts to remove him are well within the bounds of the constitution and key to its fight against corruption . He simply doesn t care about the country , Popular Force lawmaker Luz Salgado said after Kuczynski s address . Earlier this week , Salgado called for Vizcarra to govern the country through 2021 , when Kucyznski s term ends . Vizcarra and Araoz both pledged their loyalty to the center-right president on Wednesday but declined to comment on whether that meant they would resign if he was removed from office . Araoz told on Sunday that she and Vizcarra would not quit . In recent days , Kuczynski s supporters have increasingly called for his vice presidents to refuse to replace him . They believe new elections would cost Popular Force its majority amid widespread contempt for elected officials as a graft scandal taints much of the country s political class . But investors worry a new ballot could sweep anti-establishment candidates to power in one of Latin America s most stable economies . Kuczynski s government does not think it will come to that , said a government source . It expects about a dozen opposition lawmakers to oppose the motion or abstain from voting , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . Eighty-seven votes are needed to oust Kuczynski . Congress passed the motion to start presidential vacancy proceedings last week with 93 votes . On Wednesday , thousands of Peruvians marched in front of Congress to denounce what they saw as Popular Force s bid to exploit the crisis to sabotage country s democratic institutions , pointing to its recent efforts to also oust the attorney general and a justice in the Constitutional Court . Popular Force emerged from the rightwing populist movement started in the 1990s by former President Alberto Fujimori , who is serving a 25-year-sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his autocratic 1990-2000 government . The United States , where Kuczynski once held citizenship , said Peru was a strong democracy . We are confident that the Peruvian people and institutions will address this situation according to Peru s constitutional norms , the U.S. State Department s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said . The political crisis stems from a disclosure by Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ ODBES.UL ] , which has landed elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic since acknowledging bribing officials across the region for much of the century . Responding to a request by Congress , Odebrecht said it paid more than $ 4 million to consulting companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate for about a decade starting in 2004 . Some deposits were made to a company Kuczynski owned while he was minister in a government that awarded Odebrecht lucrative contracts . Odebrecht said Saturday that there was no indication the transactions were part of its past corrupt dealings with politicians , which it can only discuss with prosecutors . Kuczynski once strenuously denied ever having any ties with Odebrecht . He has since apologized to Peru for not disclosing his connections with the company , blaming forgetfulness and poor organization of his personal records after decades of work in finance and public administration . But he said there was nothing improper about the payments . Being careless and sloppy is a defect but it is not ... a tool for dishonesty and much , much less , for crime , Kuczynski said . Kuczynski had once raised hopes that his decades of finance and public administration experience would usher in a new period of investments to spur faster economic growth in the world s No.2 copper producer . But in a sign of how the crisis has engulfed his government , Peru postponed an auction of a $ 2 billion copper project , scheduled for Wednesday , until February .',\n",

Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions ? Capitol Police revoked the Awans access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected . Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members , including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [ VIDEO ] 3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission .

They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized . At a minimum they were fired . At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence , foreign affairs and intelligence committees . Okay ? So they were getting very important information , government information . They accessed these computers . That is the least of it . There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism . Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood ? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood ?

Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems , including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled , and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries , the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy . Abid had more than $ 1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church , Va. , from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress . He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005 . A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012 , but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them . He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife , Natalia Soba , were living apart and needed separate residences . My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of 707 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) of the Bankruptcy Code , Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents . But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems , including driving with a suspended or revoked license , court records show . He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House , and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s employment with our office has been terminated . Hilarie Chambers , a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin who employed Abid told TheDCNF that after being notified by the House Administration Committee , this individual was removed from our payroll . We are confident that everything in our office is secure . Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four : Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four , including Wasserman Schultz , who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails .

Proving that it was all talk and no action , the gun advocacy group had declined the opportunity to participate in the live Q & A session with the President , and basically forfeited their right to complain about the issues going forward . NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the reason the association declined was because the meeting was just a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House . However , that didn t stop the NRA from whining and giving their opinion during the town hall meeting anyway . As the organization watched Obama talk about tightening background checks and closing loopholes for gun sales , the NRA decided to live-tweet the event a choice it would immediately regret.NRA TwitterNRA TwitterNRA TwitterAs Guns In America went on , the NRA made up for its lack of physical presence by filling its Twitter feed with criticisms of Obama and shared several equally ridiculous posts from gun rights advocates . Thankfully , not everyone on Twitter is as thick-headed and came to Obama s rescue to set the NRA straight : TwitterTwitterSome even chose to remind the association to shut the f * ck up since it couldn t be bothered to confront Obama in person.TwitterObama also took some time out of the town hall to blast the NRA for backing out of the discussion and expressed his disappointment in an organization that has been so vocal against gun legislation . He said : Part of the reason I welcomed this opportunity by CNN to have a good discussion debate about it is because our position is consistently mischaracterized . There s a reason why the NRA is not here . They re just down the street . And , since this is the main reason they exist , you d think they d be prepared to have a debate with the president.I m happy to meet with them . I m happy to talk to them , but , the conversation has to be based on facts and truth , and what we re actually proposing , not some you know , imaginary fiction in which Obama s trying to take away your guns .

       " '( Corrects in 6th paragraph to clarify rules ) By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON - Democrats sliced holes in billionaire Betsy DeVos ’ credentials to be the next U.S. Education Secretary at a confirmation hearing on Tuesday , raising doubts whether President-elect Donald Trump ’ s pick will win approval in the full Senate . The nomination of DeVos to head an agency that sets policy for younger children and universities and also administers a college financial aid program of $ 1 trillion has outraged Democrats who believe the Michigan Republican wants to dismantle public education . Teachers unions , a major constituency for the party , roundly oppose DeVos , a philanthropist and investor . “ Do you think if you were not a multi-billionaire , if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions to the Republican party , that you would be sitting here today ? ” asked Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont , who recently ran to be the Democrats ’ presidential nominee . Democratic Senators have made their opposition clear in recent days in letters , speeches and most notably at the hearing . Next Tuesday , the Education Committee will likely approve sending her name to the full chamber when it votes in an executive session next Tuesday . Then , Democrats could attempt to block the nomination on the Senate floor . Because nominations other than those for the Supreme Court only require a simple majority vote , they will not be able to use a filibuster and would have to convince Republicans to join them in voting against the nomination . Former Senator Joe Lieberman , Democrats ’ candidate for vice president in 2000 , gave DeVos a laudatory introduction at the hearing , but other party members were wide-ranging in their criticism . Minnesota ’ s Al Franken expressed surprise DeVos was unfamiliar with a hot education debate over measuring student achievement by proficiency or by growth . Connecticut ’ s Chris Murphy was dismayed when DeVos did not condemn guns in schools . Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , an advocate of tough financial regulation , asked whether DeVos or her children had attended public schools , borrowed student loans or received federal financial help known as Pell grants . “ You have no experience with financial aid , ” Warren summed up when DeVos answered “ no. ” Many were dismayed DeVos would not pledge to carry out rules on sexual assault , for-profit colleges and fair access for students with disabilities , only saying she would review the policies . Generally , Democrats pressed on how DeVos will manage her investments and companies in the education sector , including an on-line charter school , while serving as the most powerful public figure in the area . They also asked repeatedly if she intended to divert money to charter schools that operate independently of school districts and are frequently run by corporations and if she would undermine public schools . “ I have major concerns with how you have spent your career and fortune fighting to privatize public education and gut investments in public schools , ” said Washington ’ s Patty Murray , the committee ’ s senior Democrat . DeVos scrambled to reassure them she supports taxpayer-backed education . She also said she will work to give parents choices in the schools their children attend , treat all students equally and respect states ’ decisions on education . The hearing , which was delayed from last week over missing financial disclosures , began at 5 p.m. ( EST ) . Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander only allotted each member five minutes for questions . Democrats called foul , saying that because DeVos has not finished requisite ethics paperwork they are in the dark on issues and need more time . Alexander said the Office of Government Ethics will produce by Friday a letter outlining resolutions for her potential conflicts of interest . Committee Republicans universally backed DeVos , applauding her support of vouchers that families may use to pay for private education and of charter schools . They praised her history with The Potter ’ s House , which provides “ Christ-centered ” education , and spoke of her dedication to literacy .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Republicans Donald Trump and Chris Christie teamed up on Monday to assail Democratic President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as weak on domestic security , making the kind of one-two punch possible if Trump picks Christie as his running mate . At a rally in Virginia Beach , Virginia , Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , and Christie , the tough-talking New Jersey governor , seized on the Dallas police shootings as examples of why Americans need a “ law and order ” candidate like Trump . Much of the debate about security in the presidential campaign has been about threats abroad . The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers last week and violence in other cities have shifted the debate back home for now . Trump , a wealthy real estate developer , presented himself as “ the law and order candidate ” and called Clinton weak . He said she has grown out of touch with the plight of ordinary Americans and cited her making paid speeches to corporate interests as a cause . “ Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives , instead of spending time with real people in real pain , ” he said . “ The disconnect in America is deep . There are two Americas : the ruling class , and the groups it favors , and then everyone else , ” said Trump . In the final days of his search for a vice presidential running mate , Trump was introduced at the event by Christie , who is one of Trump ’ s top potential picks to be his vice presidential running mate . Christie , a former rival of Trump for the presidential nomination , showed himself capable of assuming the role of political attack dog , a job the vice presidential nominee usually assumes . He suggested Obama has taken sides against police in the country ’ s debate over race and police brutality . “ We need a president who once again will put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency of this country , ” Christie said . “ Our police officers ... need to understand that the president of the United States and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt , not always believe that what they have done is somehow wrong. ” Trump has been test-driving his vice presidential possibilities . He campaigned last week with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich , and is to appear with a third No . 2 possibility , Indiana Governor Mike Pence , in Indiana on Tuesday . The New York businessman has appeared most comfortable publicly with Gingrich . Both Gingrich and Christie have been advisers for Trump behind the scenes . Trump is also considering retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for the job , but told The Washington Post in an interview published on Monday that he is leaning toward a conventional politician . “ I don ’ t need two anti-establishment people , ” Trump said . “ Someone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification . I do like unification of the Republican Party. ” Trump said he would decide on his vice presidential pick in the next three or four days . The Republican National Convention , at which he is to be nominated as the party ’ s candidate , opens in Cleveland next Monday .

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO - A U.S. senator and civil groups critical of surveillance practices on Friday called on the government to release a 2015 order by a secret court directing Yahoo to scan all its users ’ incoming email , saying it appeared to involve new interpretations of at least two important legal issues . Their concerns center on the nature of the technical assistance the court required Yahoo to provide and the scope of the search that legal experts said appeared to cover the Silicon Valley internet company ’ s entire network . Yahoo installed a custom software program to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts at the behest of U.S. intelligence officials with an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , a secret tribunal , reported on Tuesday . They were looking for messages containing a single piece of digital content , three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events told Reuters . Intelligence officials told that all Yahoo had to do was modify existing systems for stopping child pornography from being sent through its email or filtering spam messages . But the pornography filters are aimed only at video and still images and can not search text , as the Yahoo program did . The spam filters , meanwhile , are viewable by many employees who curate them , and there is no confusion about where they sit in the software stack and how they operate . The court-ordered search Yahoo conducted , on the other hand , was done by a module attached to the Linux kernel - in other words , it was deeply buried near the core of the email server operating system , far below where mail sorting was handled , according to three former Yahoo employees . They said that made it hard to detect and also made it hard to figure out what the program was doing . How much companies can be forced to do to comply with government orders for searching data is being debated in the courts . Companies have successfully argued that changes that would degrade users ’ experience or force them to write new code , essentially a form of speech , would violate basic rights . Most famously , Apple refused to write code that would unlock an iPhone belonging to a gunman in last year ’ s mass shooting in San Bernardino , California . The FBI later dropped its demand . In the case of Yahoo , company security staff discovered a software program that was scanning email but ended an investigation when they found it had been approved by Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer , the sources said . Lawmakers are concerned about the request and whether information about it is being properly disclosed to the public . “ Recent reports of a mass-email scanning program have alleged that federal law is being interpreted in ways that many Americans would find surprising and troubling , ” said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , a member of the intelligence committee and frequent critic of government surveillance programs . “ The USA Freedom Act requires the executive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the Constitution , ” Wyden said . Intelligence officials said the Yahoo order resembled other requests for monitoring online communications of suspected terrorists . The program is far different from the bulk collection of emails and telephone records that was disclosed by fugitive National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden , they said , stressing the target was a digital “ signature ” associated with a single entity ’ s suspected terrorist activity . But legal experts question whether the order might have stretched the concept of a “ facility ” used by a foreign power from its traditional definition , involving a single phone number or an email account , to include a large company ’ s entire communication network . “ If the facility means all of Yahoo ’ s network , I don ’ t see how that ’ s consistent with the Fourth Amendment , ” which bars unreasonable searches , said Greg Nojeim , senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology .',\n",
       " 'CINCINNATI , Ohio - President Donald Trump on Wednesday trumpeted plans for $ 1 trillion in U.S. infrastructure spending as he struggles to gain momentum for his economic agenda amid growing attention on the probe into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia . “ America wants to build , ” Trump said . “ There is no limit to what we can achieve . All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it happen. ” Speaking in Cincinnati , Ohio , Trump reviewed a proposal announced earlier this year to leverage $ 200 billion in his budget proposal into a $ 1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system , strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges , roads and waterways . Trump said he would not allow the United States to become a “ museum of former glory. ” He spoke about backing large transformative projects but did not give specifics . “ We will construct incredible new monuments to American grit that inspire wonder for generations and generations , ” he said . Trump pointed to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal funds with state , local , and private sector funding . Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that administration plans to unveil a detailed legislative proposal by the end of September . Democrats want $ 1 trillion in new federal spending and proposed a plan that includes $ 200 billion in roads and bridges , $ 20 billion in expanding broadband Internet access , $ 110 billion for water systems and $ 75 billion for schools . Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the Trump budget unveiled in May cuts $ 206 billion in infrastructure spending across several departments , including $ 96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending . The Ohio visit was the second leg of a week-long White House focus on infrastructure . On Monday the president proposed spinning off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration . The proposal to privatize air traffic control has run into skepticism and opposition from Democratic senators and some Republicans . The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy that Trump made last year during his presidential campaign . Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russia ’ s alleged meddling in the election . That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey , who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month , testifies before a Senate panel .',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS - An arbitration clause in an investment treaty between the Netherlands and Slovakia does not violate EU law , an adviser to the EU s top court said on Tuesday , in a legal case on an issue that has sparked fierce public debate . The Advocate General gave his opinion on an arbitration clause contained in an investment treaty stemming from 1991 between the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia , before the latter split into two countries and became a member of the European Union . In 2008 a Dutch insurer launched arbitration proceedings against Slovakia and was awarded 22.1 million euros ( $ 26.51 million ) in damages . Slovakia sought to annul the decision , arguing arbitration treaties violated EU law . The arbitration clause in the investment protection agreement concluded between the Netherlands and Slovakia is compatible with EU law , the Advocate General said . Arbitration clauses have been sharply debated in the wake of the EU s efforts to conclude trade deals with other nations and regions , seen by critics as undermining national judiciary processes . The European Court of Justice usually follows the advice given by the Advocate General .',\n",
       " '- The New York State on Wednesday confirmed Governor Andrew Cuomo ’ s pick to become the state ’ s top financial regulator .

       " 'AMMAN - The Syrian army backed by Russian jets on Wednesday stepped up shelling and air strikes on a besieged rebel-held enclave in Damascus a day after rebels stormed an army base in the area , rebels , a war monitor and residents said . The bombardment follows a surprise ground offensive by jihadist rebels on Tuesday on an army complex in the heart of the city s Eastern Ghouta region that has defied opposition assaults since the start of the conflict . The fortress-like Military Vehicles Administration in the government-held part of Harasta town has long been used to strike at the densely populated Eastern Ghouta , where over 300,000 people live under siege . Rebels have failed in repeated offensives to seize the sprawling compound , from where surface-to-surface rockets are launched against the rebel enclave . Douma , the main city in opposition-held Eastern Ghouta , is only three km away . The fighting is continuing and the shelling and air strikes are heavy near the base and most of the towns of the Ghouta , said Abu Kutaiba , a military commander for Ahrar al Sham , an Islamist rebel group that has spearheaded the attack . A Syrian military source said on state media the army had repelled terrorists who sought to infiltrate in large numbers , killing tens and destroying their weaponry . It did not mention the heavy aerial strikes on opposition areas . Backed by Russian strikes , government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent weeks , seeking to tighten a siege on the area , residents and rebels say . The rebel assault aims partly to relieve that pressure . The Eastern Ghouta is part of several de-escalation zones which Russia has brokered with rebels across Syria that has freed the army to redeploy in areas they can regain ground . The rebel offensive which began on Tuesday is the first since last March when mainstream Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) rebels staged an attack against government-held areas in northeastern Damascus . The rebels were forced to retreat after initial gains . In retaliatory attacks , aerial strikes and shelling hit Harasta , Irbin , Misraba , Hamouriya , and Saqba towns in Eastern Ghouta with at least eight civilians killed and about 94 wounded in the last 20 hours alone , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and residents . After securing the last rebel pocket inside the capital s Qaboun district last May , the Syrian army has since concentrated its military drive against Ain Terma and Jobar , northeast of the capital in the Ghouta area . Rebels helped by an elaborate network of underground tunnels have repelled repeated attempts to storm these areas . The army and its militias have failed to make any progress and have had heavy losses , said Alwan , a spokesman for the FSA s Failaq al Rahman rebel group . Backed by Russian strikes , the army has however gradually succeeded in the last year in shrinking rebel held control over Eastern Ghouta . The loss of agricultural land has compounded the humanitarian plight of civilians . The United Nations has warned of impending starvation if aid does not reach the area , where international deliveries have long been erratic and obstructed .',\n",

       " 'ERBIL Iraq - Iraqi forces have entered al-Qaim , one of the last remaining territories in the country still held by Islamic State militants , the Joint Operations Command said on Friday . Units from the Iraqi army , Counter-Terrorism Services , Sunni tribal and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation forces ( PMF ) are participating in an offensive to recapture al-Qaim and Rawa , two towns which lie on the border area with Syria . Iraq s security forces retook a border crossing with Syria from the militants , hours after entering al-Qaim , according to the Joint Operations Command . The road runs through al-Qaim in Iraq and Albu-Kamal in Syria , two towns which are very close to each other on opposite sides of the border in the last important territorial stronghold of Islamic State . Welcoming the offensive , the U.S.-led international military coalition , which has run an air campaign against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq since 2014 , said in a statement that approximately 1,500 Islamic State fighters were estimated to remain in the immediate vicinity of al-Qaim . Operations to clear the militants from their final strongholds in Iraq have continued , despite a concurrent military advance on Kurdish-held territory in the north . Iraq s central government launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to seize disputed territories , claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds , in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence held on Sept. 25 . In a lightning strike , central government forces swiftly recaptured large areas , including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk , from the Kurds , who had seized these areas when Islamic State swept across northern Iraq in 2014 . On Thursday , Iraqi forces threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds , accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses .',\n",
       " 'I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed : Here s Google : Naturally , my reaction was oh , s * * t , what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife s campaign now ? Of course , the headline sounds really , really awful . It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play , just like Donald Trump has been saying all along . Unfortunately , it takes reading beyond the headlines , which is something most people don t do , to find out the real story and the real story is that there is no pay to play . It was natural for people who ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things . And I trusted the State Department wouldn t do anything they shouldn t do , Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning . Source : CNNIn other words , people can ask for favors , but that certainly doesn t mean they ll get them . Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down . There is zero evidence of pay to play . In other words , people might have asked for favors , but there s no evidence they got them.Now , let s talk about the foundation the media doesn t like to mention , the Trump Foundation . Trump hasn t given to his own foundation since 2008 . He does collect money from others , though , and gives it in his name . He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets , all for himself , but out of charity money.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump s charitable foundation over concerns that it engaged in some impropriety as related to New York charity laws . The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself , such as a $ 20,000 oil painting of himself and a $ 12,000 autographed football helmet , and also recycled others contributions to make them appear to have come from him although he hasn t given to the foundation since 2008 . Source : Media MattersMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton s candidacy : Journalists have been criticized for the double standard in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . Earlier this month , cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post s reporting about the Trump Foundation . This week , both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump s Dr. Oz stunt.All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump . Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks , largely because the media covers every minor Clinton scandal ( if you call getting sick a scandal ) while ignoring every scandal in Trump s closet , and trust me , there are a lot.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images .',\n",
       " 'NAIROBI - A French IT company that supplied the electronic system used in Kenya s nullified election last month has told the election commission its technology will not be ready to use again by the Oct. 17 date set for a re-run of the vote . The statement presents a hurdle for the commission . It could threaten the timing of the election that President Uhuru Kenyatta , whose win on Aug. 8 win was canceled by the Supreme Court , will contest against opposition leader Raila Odinga . When the Supreme Court nullified the results of the presidential election citing irregularities , it ordered a new poll within 60 days . The commission then declared Oct. 17 as the date for the re-run . In a letter from Paris-based OT-Morpho to the election commission , the company said the two electronic systems it supplied for the vote would have to be reinstalled for the re-run . This represents a very significant amount of work , which can not be secured by October 17 , said the letter dated Sept. 18 and seen by Reuters . OT-Morpho provided 45,000 tablets for identifying voters using biometric technology and the system used to transmit results counted at polling stations as well as a photograph of the paper sheet from each station . Delays in transmission of the tally sheets was an irregularity raised by the opposition in its petition to the Supreme Court . The court has not released its full verdict but has said it will do so by Thursday . A spokesman for the company confirmed the letter was accurate . Andrew Limo , a spokesman for the election board , said he was aware of the letter and the board met on Monday to discuss it . Earlier in the day , he told that changing the date ( of the election re-run ) is a last resort strategy . The date of the new poll has been a source of tension between Kenyatta and Odinga . Kenyatta and his ruling Jubilee party have said the re-run should be held on Oct. 17 as scheduled by the commission , while the opposition is threatening to boycott the new poll if its demands for the sacking of key election officials are not met .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Large U.S. companies and their executives helped President Donald Trump raise a record-setting $ 106.7 million for inauguration festivities in January , according to a U.S. government filing released on Wednesday . That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $ 53.2 million for President Barack Obama ’ s first inauguration , which had topped the previous 2005 record of $ 42.3 million for President George W. Bush , government records showed . The biggest donor by far to Trump ’ s inauguration was Sheldon Adelson , casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp ( LVS.N ) . He gave $ 5 million , according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee ’ s filing with the Federal Election Commission . Adelson declined comment . Many of the companies that donated to Trump , a Republican , have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events . Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obama ’ s prior inauguration . For example , aerospace and defense groups Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) each donated $ 1 million to Trump ’ s inauguration fund , the filing said . Boeing had donated $ 1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration , according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics , a campaign finance watchdog . Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories , said Larry Sabato , political analyst at the University of Virginia . “ It ’ s either make-up money or it ’ s a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump . You don ’ t give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls , ” he said . Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration . In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing ’ s new Air Force One plane were “ out of control ” and urged the federal government to “ Cancel order ! ” Trump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin ’ s F-35 fighter jet was also “ out of control. ” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that inaugurations have “ pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ... This is a time-honored tradition , and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural. ” Financial services companies and executives were among the $ 1-million donors to Trump ’ s big festivities , including Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) , Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) , financier Henry Kravis and Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman Howard Lutnick . Their industry is eager for Trump to roll back regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis . Coal and oil companies were also prominent donors . Clifford Forrest , owner of the Rosebud Mining Co , gave $ 1 million . AT & T ( T.N ) gave nearly $ 2.1 million in cash and services . It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) . AT & T donated $ 4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration , according to OpenSecrets . “ For many years , AT & T has contributed to our nation ’ s presidential inaugural celebrations , ” said AT & T spokesman Mike Balmoris . Boeing , Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment . Bank of America , Charles Schwab , Forrest and Lutnick did not immediately respond to a request for comment .',\n",
       " 'PRAGUE - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis , a billionaire businessman who ran on an anti-establishment ticket , took office with his cabinet on Wednesday , but it was unclear whether his tenure will survive a confidence vote next month . Babis , who built a business empire in food , farming , chemicals and media before entering politics in 2011 , will have one month to gain confidence under the constitution for his minority government . He said after being formally appointed by Czech President Milos Zeman , that the confidence vote should take place on Jan. 10 . Running on pledges to fight immigration and make the state more efficient , Babis s ANO party won 29.6 percent of the vote in an October national election that saw the rise of other parties preaching against the establishment . As finance minister over the past three years , Babis saw the central state budget swing to a surplus and has vowed to further cut public debt ratio to GDP , currently at a half of the European Union average . His problem is that ANO holds just 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and does not have the firm backing of any of the other eight parties . The far-right , anti-EU SPD party and the far-left Communists have lent ANO support in initial parliamentary votes in return for committee posts , but no deal has been announced on their backing for the cabinet . Babis will need a few parties to either support the cabinet or leave before the confidence vote to lower the threshold the government needs to pass . Babis s government includes non-partisan ministers , in line with his pledge to bring more managerial style to governance . His first tack will be representing the country at the European Union summit on Thursday and Friday , where he will push for strengthening EU borders and stopping illegal migration . If Babis loses the confidence vote , his government will stay in power until an alternative is formed . Zeman reiterated on Wednesday his willingness to give Babis a second try if the first attempt fails , and signaled this may be the way forward . ( I have ) the impression that several ( parties ) wanted to be coaxed , but in order not to lose their dignity or prestige , they will want to be coaxed only in the second round , Zeman said . Most parties have called for Babis himself to stay out of the government due to a police case looking at whether he illegally hid ownership of a farm and conference center a decade ago to get a 2 million euro ( $ 2.35 million ) EU subsidy meant for small businesses . Babis has denied any wrongdoing . Some parties also criticize Babis for conflicts of interest as an owner of two national newspapers and a businessman whose firms have numerous contracts with the state and benefit from public aid . He placed his firms into a trust fund earlier this year , overseen by his close collaborators and his wife . Daily Hospodarske Noviny reported on Wednesday that the outgoing ruling party , the leftist Social Democrats , could support a Babis-led government in a second round of talks , if his first cabinet fails . It cited unnamed sources within that party . The other member of the outgoing coalition , the Christian Democrats , have also said they could negotiate with ANO .',\n",
       " 'BEIRUT - President Michel Aoun held talks on Monday with other Lebanese political leaders over the future of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s government , but gave no sign whether they discussed Hariri s demand the country steer clear of regional turmoil . Aoun s office said the talks were positive and constructive but did not detail steps to address the demands Hariri made after postponing his shock resignation , notably that Lebanese stick by the state policy of staying out of regional conflicts - a reference to Iran-backed Shi ite group Hezbollah . The consultations would continue once Aoun returns on Friday from an official visit to Italy , the statement said . A senior Lebanese official said the consultations at the presidential palace in Baabda aimed to help Hariri s government get back on its feet , after weeks of political instability triggered by Hariri s Nov. 4 resignation , announced in Riyadh . Lebanese officials say Saudi Arabia forced Hariri to resign and held him against his will , triggering an intervention by France which led to his return to Beirut last week . Riyadh says Hariri , Lebanon s top Sunni Muslim politician and a long-time Saudi ally , resigned freely and denies holding him . In his resignation speech , Hariri strongly criticized Iran and its heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Muslim ally Hezbollah for meddling in the Arab world . Since returning to Beirut , Hariri has said all Lebanese must stick by the state policy of disassociation , or keeping out of regional conflicts - a reference to Hezbollah . Leading Druze politician Walid Jumblatt , an influential figure in Lebanon , said after meeting Aoun that it was important to talk about disassociation , and how to achieve it . He said it would be wise not to bring up the question of Hezbollah s weapons in discussions , referring to previous rounds of futile talks on this point . The senior Lebanese official said the consultations might end with Lebanon reaffirming the ministerial statement that implicitly includes disassociation . The official spoke on condition of anonymity as Aoun s consultations were not over . Hariri said on Saturday he would not accept Hezbollah stances that affect our Arab brothers or target the security and stability of their countries .',\n",

       " 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert had a very special guest on to celebrate MLK Day Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson . Nothing could be more appropriate , and the two sat down and talked about something about 70 % of white people refuse to talk about : Race.The conversation began with Colbert s telling McKesson of the reaction to his wearing a Black Lives Matter bracelet on the air . He says that with the way his white counterparts acted , you would have thought I d slapped a baby . McKesson s frank response was , of course , spot-on : I think that people are uncomfortable talking about the racist history of this country and what we need to do to undo the impact of racism . People would just like to act like we don t have a legacy of racism here . I think people get really uncomfortable with it , but we know that we can t change it unless we address it , right ? He went on to remind Colbert and the audience what most of us have known all along : that the All Lives Matter crowd just want to distract from speaking about the real issues surrounding race . If All Lives Matter was true , we wouldn t have to be out in the streets . The police have killed 26 people just in 2016 . Indeed . McKesson then addressed the blue code of silence , which everyone is aware of . Cops don t squeal on cops even if it means covering up murder . Across the country it has been so similar , we know that it s not just isolated events . It is actually a systemic problem . He also reminded everyone of the responsibility that comes with the power of policing , especially the power to kill : That means they have a different responsibility and accountability that is not present right now . So true . They have a responsibility to serve first , and be rational , rather than militant and trigger happy.McKesson was them asked about Dr. King : People misremember King today . They remember , like , the safe King they don t remember , like , the radical revolutionary King . He talked about redistribution of wealth and economic justice he was more aggressive than the dream that people remember . McKesson , who rose to fame through Twitter , then pointed out how social media is important to today s activist , though , at the root of it all , , nothing has really changed : The issues are the same . We didn t invent resistance , we didn t discover injustice , but technology has allowed us to amplify these issues in ways that we couldn t before and has accelerated the pace of organizing in ways that are really powerful . After speaking about the Democratic candidates and his experiences with them , the conversation turned to the issue that is at the root of all of this : White privilege . Unfortunately , that is something most white people will never want to speak about . However , Colbert is definitely not afraid , and he asked McKesson how to understand his own privileges from being white . McKesson responded : It s about role , and it s about access and what you can do is extend that privilege so that you can dismantle it , right ? You can create opportunity for people , you can amplify issues in ways that other people can t and you can use your resources to create space for people . Colbert then made the ultimate confession , which is that privilege also comes with fear . I can t speak for other white people , ( but ) I feel guilty for anyone who does not have the things I have . That includes black people or anyone , because I am so blessed I think there s always a fear that it will be taken from me . And that is the very essence of why so many white people fear the breaking down of the system of white supremacy . They fear that their wealth and societal position will be taken if black people get so much as a crumb of the pie , much less a slice . But , they should fear not , for giving other people rights is not their oppression.Such a basic concept that so few understand.Watch the absolutely perfect video below : Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story',\n",

       " 'RAQQA/DUBAI - While Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was accusing the West of turning a blind eye to Islamic State smuggling , a member of his parliament was quietly doing business with the group , farmers and administrators in the militants former stronghold said . The arrangement helped the Syrian government to feed areas still under its control after Islamic State took over the northeastern wheat-growing region during the six-year-old civil war , they said . Traders working for businessman and lawmaker Hossam al-Katerji bought wheat from farmers in Islamic State areas and transported it to Damascus , allowing the group to take a cut , five farmers and two administrators in Raqqa province told Reuters . Katerji s office manager , Mohammed Kassab , confirmed that Katerji Group was providing Syrian government territories with wheat from the northeast of Syria through Islamic State territory but denied any contact with Islamic State . It is not clear how much Assad knew of the wheat trading . Cooperation over wheat between a figure from Syria s establishment , which is backed by Shi ite power Iran , and the hardline Sunni Islamic State would mark a new ironic twist in a war that has deepened regional Sunni-Shi ite divisions . contacted Katerji s office six times to request comment but was not given access to him . His office manager Kassab , asked how the company managed to buy and transport the wheat without any contact with Islamic State , said : It was not easy , the situation was very difficult . When asked for details he said only that it was a long explanation . He did not return further calls or messages . Damascus , under U.S. and EU sanctions over the conflict and alleged oil trading with Islamic State , strongly denies any business links with the hardline Islamist militants , arguing that the United States is responsible for their rise to power . The self-declared caliphate they set up across large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 has all but collapsed after Western-backed forces drove them out of their Iraqi stronghold , Mosul and surrounded them in Raqqa , where they are now confined to a small area . Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian forces are attacking them elsewhere , such as Deir al Zor on Syria s eastern border , where Kassab says he was speaking from , in a continuing struggle for the upper hand between world powers . Five farmers in Raqqa described how they sold wheat to Katerji s traders during Islamic State rule in interviews at the building housing the Raqqa Civil Council , formed to take over once the city is retaken . The operation was organized , said Mahmoud al-Hadi , who owns agricultural land near Raqqa and who , like the other farmers , had come to the council s cement offices to seek help . I would sell to small traders who sent the wheat to big traders who sent it on to Katerji and the regime through two or three traders , he said . He and the other farmers said they all had to pay Islamic State a 10 percent tax , or zakat , and sold all of their season s supplies to Katerji s traders under the multi-layered scheme . Local officials said Katerji s traders bought up wheat from Raqqa and Deir al-Zor and gave Islamic State 20 percent . If a truck is carrying 100 sacks , they ( Islamic State ) would keep 20 and give the rest to the trucker , said Awas Ali , a deputy of the Tabqa joint leadership council , a similar , post-Islamic State local body allied to the Kurdish-led forces now attacking Raqqa . Ali said he learned of the details of the arrangement with Katerji by speaking with Islamic State prisoners and others who worked in the group s tax collection and road tolling systems . Katerji s trucks were well known and the logo on them was clear and they were not harassed at all , Ali said , adding that Katerji s people were active during the last buying season , which lasts from May to August . The farmers also said the trucks were identifiable as Katerji s. The truck drivers were even allowed to smoke cigarettes as they passed through the checkpoints , something Islamic State enforcers punished with whippings elsewhere , Ali and several other sources said . I would sell an entire season s supplies to Katerji s traders , said farmer Ali Shanaan . They are known traders . The checkpoints stopped the trucks and Daesh would take a cut and let them pass , he said , using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State . The wheat was transported via the New bridge over the Euphrates River to a road leading out of Raqqa , the farmers and local officials said . Control of the bridge is now unclear as the militants in Raqqa come close to defeat . Raqqa-based lawyer Abdullah al-Aryan , who said he had been a consultant for some of Katerji s traders , said Katerji s trucks brought goods into Islamic State territory as well as wheat out . Food used to come from areas controlled by the government . Medicine and food , he said . Islamic State rule involved shooting or beheading perceived opponents in public squares , imposing its own extreme version of sharia , Islamic law , and then providing basic goods such as bread and setting up ministries and taxation . Several farmers said they saw Islamic State documents which were stamped at checkpoints to allow the wheat trucks to pass . They belonged to the department which imposes taxes . Islamic State may have exported some of the wheat . Local officials and farmers said the militants , as well as a rebel group , had sold the contents of grain silos in the northeast to traders across the Turkish border . Assad has accused his enemies , including Turkey and Western countries , of supporting the group , something they deny . In an interview in March with a Chinese news agency , published by Syrian state news agency SANA , Assad said : As for the other side , which is the United States , at least during the Obama administration , it dealt with Daesh through overlooking its smuggling of Syrian oil to Turkey , and in that way Daesh was able to procure money in order to recruit terrorists from all over the world . Asked whether Syrian companies were dealing with Islamic State to secure wheat , Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharbi said in August : No , not at all . Speaking to at a Damascus trade fair , he added : This doesn t exist at all . We are importing wheat from Russian companies in addition to our local crop and this talk is completely unacceptable . The wheat buying season ended in August and IS has lost control of the wheat-growing areas , either to government forces or the Syrian Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces . Assad has traditionally relied on a close-knit set of businessmen most notably Rami Makhlouf , his maternal cousin , to help keep Syria s economy afloat . Makhlouf is subject to international sanctions and relies on various associates to do business . Katerji is a household name around Raqqa and elsewhere . Farmer Hadi likened him to a late Greek shipping tycoon , Aristotle Onassis . Katerji is the Onassis of Syria , he said . Katerji s facebook profile page shows him shaking hands with Assad and he regularly posts pictures of the president , who he describes as a beacon of light for pan-Arabism , patriotism and loyalty . He is member of parliament for Aleppo , a key battleground recovered by the government late last year , and is part of a new business class that has risen to prominence during the war . The United States and EU have imposed a range of measures targeted both at the government and some of the many armed groups operating in Syria , but foodstuffs are not restricted . U.S. and European sanctions on banking and asset freezes have , however , made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Assad s government and made local supplies increasingly vital . Flat bread is a subsidized staple for Syrians , who have suffered under a conflict estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes . The government needs around 1.5 million tonnes annually to feed the areas it controls and keep Syrians on Assad s side . Syria s bread-basket provinces of Hasaka , Raqqa and Deir al-Zor account for nearly 70 percent of total wheat production . While the government looks set to retake much of Deir al-Zor province soon , Hasaka is mostly under the control of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia , who are also likely to hold sway in Raqqa along with Arab allied groups . Ali , from the Tabqa council , predicted that would not stop the wheat trade . People like Katerji , with a lot of money and power , their activities will never be completely frozen , he said . It is just going to disappear from one area and go to another .',\n",
       " 'BRASILIA/SAO PAULO - Brazil s new top federal prosecutor on Tuesday reshuffled the team of investigators in charge of pursuing the biggest corruption probe yet conducted in Latin America s largest nation . Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge , who took over the post on Monday after the end of her predecessor Rodrigo Janot s term , had previously invited all the members of Janot s team of prosecutors working on the Car Wash corruption probe to stay . However , few expressed interest in continuing , and Dodge , 56 , who holds a master s degree from Harvard and has spent three decades working as a federal prosecutor , decided to replace the entire team with her own choices . Just a few of the previous prosecutors will stay on for a month to help with the transition . The Car Wash investigation , which began in early 2014 , has led to an unprecedented fight against entrenched political corruption in Brazil . It has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid by major construction firms to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises such Petroleo Brasileiro in return for lucrative contracts . It is one of several major investigations taking place in Brazil , probes that have led to the conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and charges being leveled against President Michel Temer , his predecessor Dilma Rousseff , and two more former presidents . Charges have been lodged or investigations opened against dozens of federal lawmakers , while over 100 powerful businessmen and politicians have been convicted . While there was a clear personal rift between Janot and Dodge , whose appointment by Temer was ratified by the Senate in August , that does not necessarily mean federal prosecutors will be any less aggressive in pursuing corruption . Obviously there will be a change in style , but there will be no change in the course of investigations , said Carlos Pereira , a professor of public policy at the Getulio Vargas Foundation and one of Brazil s top experts on corruption . But the team chosen by ( Dodge ) is extremely professional and has already shown skills in fighting corruption . Among the prosecutors who will be part of Dodge s Car Wash investigation team are veterans from Brazil s first major probe into political corruption , the 2005 Mensalao scandal . It ended with top members of Lula s government being found guilty of paying off lawmakers in return for their support of Lula s legislation .',\n",

       " \"Here s the REAL reason Mitt Romney came out against Trump . If you can t beat a candidate ON THE SAME TEAM fair and square , resort to plan B right ? Ironically , if the GOP establishment fought back against Obama as hard as they re fighting against Trump , he wouldn t likely be the front-runner right now.Former Speaker of the House John Boehner has endorsed current Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-WI ) for president , in the event that no Republican candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.Politico reports that Boehner , speaking at a conference in Boca Raton , Florida , said : If we don t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot , I m for none of the above . They all had a chance to win . None of them won . So I m for none of the above . I m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee . Late Tuesday evening , as results from primary contests confirmed Donald Trump s victories in four out of five states , CNBC reported that Ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.EXCLUSIVE : Paul Ryan wo n't categorically rule out accepting GOP nominationif a deadlocked convention turns to him https : //t.co/kuxSyWEDZg CNBC Now ( @ CNBCnow ) March 16 , 2016Ryan was welcomed by conservatives as Mitt Romney s choice for running mate in 2012 . The pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements , and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in Obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.In the aftermath of that 2012 loss , Ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing , convinced that Republicans shared responsibility with Democrats and the president . As a result , he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support . Via : Breitbart News\",\n",
       " '- Delegates at both the Republican and the Democratic conventions sported outrageous outfits - but the views from their respective gatherings were a study in contrast . Republican National Convention delegates in Cleveland last week embraced a freewheeling , policy-light lineup , reveling in messages of salvation from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’ s inner circle , while expressing their fears that America has become less safe . A man wearing an orange jumpsuit and Hillary Clinton mask told he had been asked to take pictures standing next to “ hundreds ” of convention-goers , while “ lock her up ” - a cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - became the crowd ’ s go-to chant . A woman wearing a red cape with “ TRUMP ” spelled out in twinkle lights happily posed for the dozens of passersby requesting photos . The few remaining , weary Ted Cruz supporters found a rallying cry in the former Republican presidential candidate ’ s refusal to endorse Trump , a moment of party discord that prompted security to escort Heidi Cruz out of the convention hall and away from irate , yelling Trump supporters . At this week ’ s Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , erstwhile candidate Bernie Sanders worked to build a bridge over troubled waters ( yes , Paul Simon performed the song of that name ) . At the end of a roll call of state delegations , he called for Clinton to be nominated by voice vote - a show of support and a bid for unity after a bitter primary campaign . The move prompted deafening cheers on the convention floor - as well as a boos from Sanders supporters , who , on occasion , could be seen angrily arguing with Clinton backers . And there were celebrities - actresses Eva Longoria , Lena Dunham , America Ferrera , Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth Banks drew shrieks and cheers from the crowd . But Clinton ’ s convention was heavy on policy and calls to public service . Former President Bill Clinton received a rock star ’ s welcome before ticking off a list of his wife ’ s civic accomplishments . First lady Michelle Obama drove some members of a rapt audience to tears when she declared , “ I wake up in a house built by slaves. ” photographers caught up with several convention-goers , both Republican and Democrat , and asked “ If you could speak to your nominee , What would you like them to know about your hopes for the future of America ? ” Here are some of their responses : “ Thank you for having my back , ” Sharon Jackson , a delegate from Alaska at the Republican convention , said , referring to Trump . Barbara Finger , a delegate from Wisconsin at the Republican conclave , also expressed gratitude to the New York businessman . “ Keep going the way you are , ” she said . “ Make America great again. ” Lavon Bracy , a Democratic delegate from Florida , expressed her support for Clinton at her party ’ s convention , emphasizing the importance of unity . She said she hopes , “ We can all live together in harmony and understand that we have differences and appreciate those who are different. ” Democratic delegate Alvin Peters of Panama City , Florida , said he , too , hoped for brighter days . “ Spread the joy , ” said Peters . “ Dispel the doom and gloom. ” photo slideshow : reut.rs/2aAmRRd',\n",

       " \"The planned right-wing extremist event Paul Revere 2016 Final March to Restore America hit a snag on Monday when one of the organizers was shot dead . No , the socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist tyrant Obama didn t have him killed , and he certainly wasn t taken out because he threatens the New World Order s agenda to use chemtrails and HAARP to kill Christians Charles Carter died at the hands of a fellow conservative in an argument over ( shockingly ) a gun.Authorities have not released details of the shooting , which occurred in Grayson County , Texas , but the Paul Revere event page announced Carter s death in an emotional plea to God to give the poster understanding of the incident.Apparently , God responded , as the event page s current administrator , an organizer of the failure that was the 2 Million bikers 2 DC rally , Bill Williamson , had many more details later in the day . I am behooved as to what has happened with Charles Carter and Vincent Smith from the Paul Revere event , the admin complained . The event that sky rocketed in a week has gone to hell and a handbasket in less then 24 hours Charles is dead , shot in the fore head by Vincent Smith . The administrator explained that Carter attacked fellow organizer Smith in a drunken argument over a gun ( though Smith was allegedly sober ) : I was in chat with Charles Carter most of the morning and I could see in his post that shit was not right within him . Shortly after Vincent shot Charles then I was on the phone with him and he explained what happened , Vincent was attacked by Charles that was liquored up and enraged . Charles attacked Vincent , snatched his side arm from him and was going to shoot Vincent . Vincent had a spare gun on him and was SOBER and faster then Charles Carter . Vincent Smith I Pray for You Brother as I am Praying for Charles Carter . I Pray that you both find peace . The Texas Marshal has ruled this a self defense , and from talking to Vincent IN DEPTH I Bill Williamson BELIEVE HIM ! the administrator wrote . If I am wrong them so be it . Right-wing online radio host Keith Williams also shared his sorrow over the unnecessary example of responsible gun ownership . Williams says that Carter was killed by a fellow patriot who was suppose to be his brother in arms and friend . One of their fellow patriots says Carter was shot between the eyes . Recently , the state of Texas made it completely legal to open carry handguns . While it is a felony in the state to carry any firearm while intoxicated , conservatives have traditionally opposed any and all firearms safety laws , viewing them as some sort of plot to grab guns from patriots like them . Unfortunately , we can expect to see responsible gun owners and good guys with guns ( as the NRA calls every ( white ) person carrying a weapon until , of course , they commit a crime ) shooting their friends family members , and enemies alike until we reform our firearms laws.Watch a video of Carter ironically begging conservatives to stop fighting with each other below : ( function ( d , s , id ) { var js , fjs = d.getElementsByTagName ( s ) [ 0 ] ; if ( d.getElementById ( id ) ) return ; js = d.createElement ( s ) ; js.id = id ; js.src = `` //connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js # xfbml=1 & version=v2.3 '' ; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore ( js , fjs ) ; } ( document , 'script ' , 'facebook-jssdk ' ) ) ; Stop behaving like childrenPAUL REVERE 2016 FINAL MARCH TO RESTORE AMERICA ( PAGE ) WAKE UP AMERICA ( PAGE ) Posted by Charles Carter on Saturday , January 9 , 2016Featured image via screengrab\",\n",
       " 'LONDON - Iran will reopen all its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan region in the coming days , lifting restrictions imposed after last month s Kurdish vote in favor of independence , its chief of staff said on Monday . The announcement comes a day after Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1 , after the independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered military action by the Baghdad . After the vote , Iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdish government . Iran , which has its own Kurdish minority , also opposes independence for Iraqi Kurds , and at the request of Baghdad closed its borders with the Kurdish region in northern Iraq and halted all flights there and back . Border restrictions between Iran and Iraq s Kurdish region will be lifted in coming days , Iran s Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Baqeri was quoted as saying by ISNA Tehran already re-opened the Bashmagh crossing last week . Baqeri also said if Kurdistan implemented its plan to break away from Iraq , there would be bloodshed in Iraq and neighboring countries would be affected . Abadi wants to take control of the border crossings between the Kurdish region and Turkey , Iran and Syria , including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey .',\n",
       " 'TIMIKA , Indonesia - The Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc closed the main access road to its giant copper mine in the eastern province of Papua on Tuesday for the second time in three days after another shooting incident . A Freeport vehicle was hit by gunfire while it was heading from Tembagapura to Ridge Camp , the company said in a statement , referring to an area where Freeport workers live . One passenger in the vehicle suffered a bullet wound to his thigh but was in a stable condition at a local clinic , according to the statement . Security apparatus were on the scene investigating the incident , it said . One source initially described the vehicle as a patrol car . The Freeport statement said it was a light armored vehicle . It is the second time the access road to the Grasberg mine has been closed since Sunday , and follows a string of shooting incidents since mid-August that have injured at least seven people and killed one police officer . The violence has escalated security concerns around the mine to their highest level in more than five years . The separatist West Papua National Liberation Army ( TPN-OPM ) , a group linked to the Free Papua Movement , has said it is at war with police , military and Freeport . It was not immediately clear if TPN-OPM were behind the latest shootings .',\n",

A D.C. court tossed out her conviction and set a new trial , but now the DOJ has dropped the case entirely : Here s the Justice Department s notice it s dropping charges against woman who laughed at Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing . pic.twitter.com/Dv5vqzxdPA Dominic Holden ( @ dominicholden ) November 7 , 2017Fairooz own reaction to the news says it all about the stupidity of this endeavor : Just received this , Governments Notice of Nolle Prosequi What a relief ! Guess they ve got enough laughing matters to deal with ! Desiree Fairooz ( @ desireefairooz ) November 6 , 2017She laughed because she felt Senator Shelby s overly-syrupy remarks about Sessions alleged record of treating everyone equally were as ridiculous as they sound . Sessions treats people anything but equally and he has a long track record of that . Code Pink s campaign director said Fairooz laughter was a reflex action more than anything , which actually does make a lot of sense . Fairooz herself didn t mean to actually laugh , but she did say : I felt it was my responsibility as a citizen to dissent at the confirmation hearing of Senator Jeff Sessions , a man who professes anti-immigrant , anti-LGBT policies , who has voted against several civil rights measures and who jokes about the white supremacist terrorist group the Ku Klux Klan . That s the whole problem , though : The Trump administration doesn t want dissent . And while it s true that Fairooz had several prior arrests for protesting , the number of cases publicly brought against dissenters of this administration is absolutely astonishing . This is a victory for all who stand for what s right which is the opposite of what Trump s administration stands for.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK - Pop star Demi Lovato is jazzed about Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton . Comic Sarah Silverman ’ s enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders is no joke . Meanwhile , 1980s sitcom star Scott Baio wants Republican businessman Donald Trump to be in charge . With Tuesday ’ s New York primary approaching and California ’ s contest scheduled for June , celebrities are getting increasingly vocal about their presidential picks . The trend is prompting newfound alliances and rifts among Hollywood ’ s elite , many of whom have donated to candidates vying for the office and actively campaigned for them . Celebrities are hardly shy about voicing their political preferences , but their opinions could carry more weight this year . The primaries in New York and California , where many of them live , actually matter for a change . Usually , both parties ’ nominees for president are effectively determined earlier in the process . Prominent female comedians are split on whom they support in the Nov. 8 election . While Silverman is backing Sanders , two actresses who have played Clinton in satirical sketches on the show “ Saturday Night Live ” say they are fans of the former secretary of state . Amy Poehler appeared in a Clinton campaign video while Kate McKinnon said on an episode of “ Close/Up with The Hollywood Reporter ” last year that she is rooting for her . And cast members from the 1980s sitcom “ Cheers ” are not toasting the same candidate . George Wendt is listed on Sanders ’ website as a supporter while Ted Danson recently campaigned for Clinton in New Hampshire . Meanwhile , Kirstie Alley voiced enthusiastic support for Trump last week , sparking a Twitter storm . “ HELLO BOYS ! This is my formal endorsement of @ realDonaldTrump & I ’ m a woman ! ( last I checked ) , ” Alley tweeted . As primary results roll in , like-minded luminaries among the politically active rich and famous are linking up with each other on social media to show their support in numbers . Last week , Jamie Lee Curtis tweeted a photo of herself with “ Scandal ” star Kerry Washington . Both women squeezed into a shirt together that said “ Yaaas , Hillary ! ” Love for a fellow supporter can come in the form of a tweet . After singer Barbra Streisand questioned the criticism over the former first lady ’ s paid speeches in a tweet in late March , “ Girls ” star Lena Dunham , who has campaigned for Clinton , declared on Twitter that she was inclined to marry the ten-time Grammy Award winner . Others are engaging in political spats as raucous as the bickering on a Bravo reality show . Actresses Debra Messing and Susan Sarandon traded barbs last month on Twitter over their support for Clinton and Sanders , respectively . Sarandon suggested that “ principled people ” might have difficulty voting for Clinton due to her environmental record . “ Did you see how @ SusanSarandon just called us unprincipled ? ” Messing tweeted to fellow actress and Clinton supporter Kathy Najimy . “ Alright @ DebraMessing report me to the homeroom teacher and let ’ s STOP , ” Sarandon replied . On the Republican side , celebrity Trump supporters are defending themselves on social media . Singer Aaron Carter ’ s Twitter endorsement of Trump in February prompted a barrage of snarky comments . He later wrote , “ NO ! you guys aren ’ t going to bully me into my beliefs. ” While many celebrities are staunch in their views on the next president , some are trying to be more open-minded . Caitlyn Jenner , who famously revealed her identity as a transgender woman last year , said in an interview on the “ Today Show ” in March that she was a Republican . But her daughter Kendall and stepdaughter Kim Kardashian , as well as fellow costars on Jenner ’ s reality show “ I Am Cait , ” are Clinton fans . A month ago , Jenner posted a photo on Instagram with Clinton with the hashtags # learningfrommygirls and # willingtolisten . Still , Clinton fans would be wise not to count her as a supporter just yet . On a March episode of her show , Jenner said she would “ never ever ever vote for Hillary . ”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Satellite images taken this month of a North Korean naval shipyard indicate Pyongyang is pursuing an aggressive schedule to build its first operational ballistic missile submarine , a U.S. institute reported on Thursday . Washington-based 38 North , a North Korea monitoring project , cited images taken on Nov. 5 showing activity at North Korea s Sinpo South Shipyard . The presence of what appear to be sections of a submarine s pressure hull in the yards suggests construction of a new submarine , possibly the SINPO-C ballistic missile submarine - the follow-on to the current SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine , 38 North said in a report . The report said that throughout 2017 there had been continued movement of parts and components into and out of two parts yards adjacent to the constructions halls in the center of the shipyard . It said the Nov. 5 images showed two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine s pressure hull . It said these appeared larger than those for North Korea s ROMEO-class attack submarine . Images of a test stand indicated continued testing of a mechanism for ejection launch of missiles from a submarine . However , the report said no activity could be seen suggesting preparations for a new test of a submarine-launched missile . North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States , sparking a major international crisis in which U.S. President Donald Trump has said that all options are under consideration , including military ones . North Korea is also thought to be working on a solid-fuel missile for submarine launches . Last month , The Diplomat magazine quoted a U.S. government source as saying U.S. military intelligence had detected a new diesel-electric submarine under construction at Sinpo and dubbed it the Sinpo-C . It said the submarine was likely a larger successor to North Korea s single experimental ballistic missile submarine . North Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests this year and its largest and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3 . The past two months have seen a relative lull and it has not tested a missile since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15 . Another article in The Diplomat last month quoted a U.S. government source as saying that North Korea had tested a new solid fuel engine sometime between Oct. 15 and Oct. 21 . U.S. intelligence officials have declined to comment on this .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - A divided U.S. Senate on Thursday killed a regulation that had exempted city-run retirement savings plans for low-income workers from strict pension protection laws . Utah Republican Orrin Hatch , the resolution ’ s sponsor , has said he expects the Senate to soon repeal a related rule on state-operated retirement plans . That resolution may face a tougher time than the one on municipal plans , which barely passed in a 50-49 vote . States are farther along establishing retirement programs for people who do not have workplace savings plans , and Republicans who advocate for states ’ rights are more skeptical of the resolution . The House of Representatives has already passed both resolutions . Thursday ’ s vote marked the 12th time the Republican-controlled Congress has successfully killed an Obama-era regulation through the use of an obscure 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act . The law lets Congress repeal a newly minted rule through simple majority votes in the House and Senate , and a signature from the president . A “ substantially similar ” rule can never be enacted in its place . The Labor Department rule was finalized after May 2016 , putting it into the window of time set by the law when Congress can repeal it . Using the resolutions , Republicans have sent rules spanning a variety of areas to the chopping block in hopes of loosening regulation they say constricts economic growth . Thursday ’ s resolution and its near-twin for state plans counters the trend by maintaining regulatory requirements . Toward the end of President Barack Obama ’ s tenure , his Labor Department exempted both state and city-run retirement plans from the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act , or ERISA , a law designed to protect workers ’ savings with detailed compliance requirements . Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401 ( k ) or other retirement benefits , and who often have low incomes , are automatically enrolled in the plans being launched in states such as California , Illinois and Oregon . States say the ERISA exemption lets employers pass workers ’ money into plans without footing compliance costs . They also say Wall Street wants to block the plans because they create competition . But the Investment Company Institute , a mutual funds trade group , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others in financial services say the exemptions shortchange workers from important federal pension protections that other workers receive .',\n",

       " '- The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the son of President Donald Trump ’ s former national security adviser to provide documents and testimony as part of the panel ’ s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election , a source familiar with the congressional matter told Reuters . Michael G. Flynn was a close aide to his father , former U.S. Army general Michael Flynn , 58 , who was fired by Trump three weeks into his White House job in February as he came under scrutiny for his foreign contacts . The son managed his father ’ s schedule and accompanied him on trips while working at Flynn Intel Group consultancy , including one to Moscow in 2015 for an event where the elder Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Russia has repeatedly denied the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the presidential campaign to help Republican Trump by hacking Democratic Party emails and spreading propaganda online . Barry Coburn , a lawyer for the younger Flynn , 34 , declined to comment on the Senate committee ’ s request , which was reported earlier by NBC News . The panel could issue a subpoena to the younger Flynn , although he could invoke his Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against self-incrimination and not comply . The elder Flynn has also been asked by the panel to provide information and to testify . A source close to Flynn said that he had turned over documents to intelligence committees in both the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives . The source familiar with the congressional investigation said that the Senate committee is not satisfied and wants to obtain more evidence from him . The source also confirmed that the Senate panel was issuing a subpoena to former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page after Page declined committee requests that he voluntarily turn over records related to any contacts with Russians . Page told in an email on Tuesday that he was “ cooperating with everyone in D.C. who might want my help in the interest of helping our country get to the end of this witch hunt. ” Page has said it was touched off by the circulation of a dossier produced by former British spy Christopher Steele on purported links between Trump , his advisers and Russia . The Senate committee , which has sought to speak with Steele , is also investigating whether there was any collusion between then-candidate Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow officials . Trump has denied any collusion by his associates , calling it “ fake news. ” The Flynn consultancy ’ s business activities are under scrutiny by congressional and federal investigators mainly because of the lobbying work it did for a Turkish businessman . Various congressional panels are sparring over Steele ’ s reports outlining Russian financial and personal links to Trump ’ s campaign and associates .',\n",
       " 'The Swedes have apparently reached their limit on tolerance for Muslim refugees who have no intention of assimilating . Since 1975 , rapes in Sweden have increased by 1,475 % !

Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish , crime has exploded . Violent crime has increased by over 300 % and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472 % .Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage : Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose , yet she is expected to love and honor him , even though he beats her and treats her badly . Her parents ( the government ) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him . Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated ? Alexandra von Schwerin , whose farm who was robbed three times . Police refused to help.Once upon a time , there was a safe welfare state called Sweden , where people rarely locked their doors.Now , this country is a night-watchman state each man is on his own . When the Minister of Justice , Morgan Johansson , encourages breaking the law , it means opening the gates to anarchy . Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried , with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year equivalent to 2 % of Sweden s current population . The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year , or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing : demand for firearms licenses is increasing ; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups . After a slight dip in 2014 , the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year . According to police statistics , there are 1,901,325 licensed guns , owned by 567,733 people , in Sweden . Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons . To get a gun permit in Sweden , you need to be at least 18 years old ; law-abiding ; well-behaved , and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club . In 2014 , 11,000 people got a hunting license : 10 % more than the year before . One out of five was a woman . There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now , says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone . It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment . People have lost confidence in the State , he added . The police will not come anymore . Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks , they run out with a baseball bat . It is no use calling the police , but if you hit the thief , you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel . Many homeowners say the same thing : they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed . But this is risky : the police can then say you have been prepared to use force , and that might backfire on you . The salesman , who asked to remain anonymous , also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups , in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves : Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing . But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village . They can see what has happened in other places . One blog , detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens , is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ) . There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott ; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society , and are therefore considered hostile to Swedes . At another security company , a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility , his firm is swamped with calls . The next day , he said , half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems . Ronny Fredriksson , spokesman of the security company Securitas , said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago , when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns . This , he said , could result in response times of several hours . More and more people now employ the services of our security guards . Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards . We are kind of like the local beat cops of old . Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards , Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society : The problem is that we too need the police . When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person , we call the police but the response times are often very long . Sometimes , the detainees get violent and quite rowdy . On occasion , the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended , if we have his identity , because they do not have a patrol nearby . Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015 , Swedes felt a need to protect themselves and with good reason . Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish , crime has exploded . Violent crime has increased by more than 300 % , and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472 % .The politicians , however , ignore the people s fear completely . It is never discussed . Instead , the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism . Most likely , that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands , and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same , some people do not settle for that . It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden . Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses . So far , miraculously , no one has been hurt . These fires are set not only by Swedes . On October 13 , a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided . The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep . Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room , and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire .

       " 'LONDON - Iran s Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years , mostly on spying charges , according to lawyers , diplomats and relatives , twice as many as earlier reported by local or international media . The number marks a sharp rise since 2015 , when an international nuclear deal raised hopes of detente with the West . In the years before that the number of dual nationals detained at any given time was in single figures . It also points up a new trend as a majority of those arrested since then , 19 out of the 30 , have citizenship in Europe . Previously most of the detainees were Iranian Americans . Detainees relatives and lawyers said the Guards were using them as bargaining chips in international relations and to put off European firms that sought business in Iran after the government agreed the deal with world powers to lift sanctions . The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has vast business interests as well as being Iran s most powerful security force and has criticized the government for handing contracts to foreigners . The Guards did not respond to several requests for comment . The Iranian government referred to the judiciary , which also did not respond to repeated approaches . Iranian authorities have previously denied holding detainees for ransom and accuse Western governments of holding Iranians on trumped-up charges . Relatives of dual nationals detained in Iran , their lawyers and Western diplomats shared information such as name , date of arrest and any charges , on condition neither they nor the detainees were identified , citing fear of repercussions . Iran does not routinely announce arrests or charges and does not recognize dual nationals , whose rights to consular assistance are enshrined in the U.N. Vienna Convention . In all cases , the sources said the detainees had not carried out any espionage and were arrested only because of their second citizenship . They explained their willingness to share details by saying they had been kept in the dark by both the Iranian authorities and Western governments . Several governments argue that maintaining a low profile is in the best interests of the detainees . This is very much what guides our approach , a UK government source said . Dutch Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Daphne Kerremans said identifying detainees could get the prisoners into trouble . Some relatives only break their silence once their initial hopes have been dashed . The wife of Ahmadreza Djalali , a Swedish-based Iranian scientist arrested in 2016 after attending a conference in Tehran , decided to speak out in February . We were all hopeful that he would be released soon . He was calling us from jail , saying he had not been officially charged . They had told him that he would be released after answering a few questions , Vida Mehrannia said by telephone from Stockholm . I made the case public to media after nine months when he was threatened with a death sentence by a prosecutor and went on a hunger strike , she added . Djalali was sentenced to death in October on espionage charges . Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said at the time : We will point out that this will affect the relationship with the EU , and this in a time when Iran and the EU need to cooperate , not least with the nuclear deal we have with Iran . The deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran s nuclear program was international , but significant U.S. restrictions remained in place . Official confirmation of new arrests sometimes emerges indirectly . Records of a session of the European Parliament in June 2017 showed three Dutch-Iranian nationals were in jail in Iran . Only one case has been reported . Asked about the two unknown cases , Dutch Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Kerremans told the individuals were arrested in November 2012 and January 2016 and said government actions were mostly aimed at ensuring an honest trial , not demanding release . It is very difficult for the Dutch government to lend support since Iran does not recognize the Dutch nationality of the prisoners , and gives little to no information about them , she said . In January 2016 , then-British Prime Minister David Cameron raised the issue of three dual UK-Iran nationals held in Iranian prisons in a phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , according to a transcript posted on the Downing Street website . Only two of those cases were known to the public at the time . Contacted for comment , a UK foreign ministry spokesman declined to specify how many British-Iranian dual nationals had been arrested . London raised all cases with Iran at every available opportunity , he said . Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe , an Iranian-British aid worker employed by the Thomson Foundation , was arrested in April 2016 while on holiday in Iran and later charged with plotting to overthrow Iran s clerical establishment . The foundation and her family have repeatedly denied the accusations . The only thing that as a family we can do is to point out the injustice of this , said her husband Richard Ratcliffe . He and others said this week that Foreign Minister Boris Johnson had made inaccurate comments about her to members of parliament that had been seized on by the Iranian judiciary and used to frame her . Johnson had said , she was simply teaching people journalism . He subsequently said the UK government has no doubt that she was on holiday in Iran and that his comments could have been clearer . My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime , not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity , he said . In 2016 , Iran released five U.S. citizens in a prisoner exchange as the nuclear deal was implemented . One remained behind and six American citizens or permanent residents have been arrested since , their lawyers or relatives have told media , of whom one has been freed on bail . A U.S. State Department official confirmed three cases , did not comment on two others and mentioned another detainee , Nizar Zakka , saying he was unjustly held and calling for his release without clarifying his U.S. status . Asked for more details about Zakka and other detained US citizens and legal residents , the official said the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad was a top priority , adding : Due to privacy considerations , we have no further comment . In an October 25 letter to the U.N. Secretary General seen by Reuters , Zakka s lawyer Jason Poblete said his client was a U.S. permanent resident and is being held as a hostage , as are other innocent persons , to exact political concessions from the United States and other governments , including on sanctions . For its part , Iran says its nationals are detained unjustly in the West . Kazem Gharibabadi , deputy head of Iran s Council for Human Rights , part of the judiciary , has said more than 56 Iranians are imprisoned in the United States and an unspecified number in other countries . Some of those are detained under baseless charges , including bypassing sanctions , he was quoted as saying by state media on Sunday . U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment on Gharibabadi s figure , saying the Justice Department does not track prosecutions by nationality and the U.S. government s Bureau of Prisons does not track how many inmates have Iranian nationality . He said inmates in U.S. federal prison are serving sentences handed down by federal judges after thorough due process of law .',\n",
       " 'The left is truly becoming unhinged ! The tension is high and the stakes are even higher in Washington as the Senate goes forward with debate on a bill to repeal Obamacare . While the US Senate voted today to open debate on the Obamacare bill , screams from far left protestors erupted from the Senate gallery . This far left mob chanted phrases such as Kill the Bill , Don t Kill Us , and Shame . The protesters interrupted the proceedings before the calling of the roll for nearly two minutes . It then took several minutes for the Sergeant of Arms and federal officers to remove the group of far left protestors . Many official Congressional votes require the gallery visitors to be given passes by legislators . It is highly likely that Democratic legislators gave these protestors access to the gallery.The emotional return of Sen.

       " 'MEXICO CITY - Irrespective of whether Mexico ’ s decision to extradite drug kingpin Joaquin “ Chapo ” Guzman aimed to honor outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama or appease his successor , Donald Trump , law enforcement from both countries say it bodes well for security cooperation . Guzman , the feared boss of the Sinaloa cartel who shot to international stardom after two jailbreaks , was extradited from a prison in northern Mexico to New York on Thursday , the eve of Trump ’ s inauguration . While some Mexican government officials believed Guzman ’ s removal served as a valediction for Obama ’ s presidency , others saw it as an opening gambit in what are likely to be fraught trade negotiations with a seemingly unfriendly Trump administration . But current and former law enforcement officials on both sides of the border said the move would boost security cooperation and could even upgrade relations . “ What happened today is something that ’ s a victory for both Mexico and the United States , ” said Leo Silva , who worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey until 2015 . “ This will obviously improve things. ” According to a senior U.S. law enforcement official based in Mexico , both U.S. and Mexican security forces were already “ three steps ahead ” in identifying the next Chapo . “ From the Mexico side , they work with us a lot , a lot more than people think , ” said the official , who was not authorized to speak with press . “ They think they ’ re going to get more support from us , they ’ re on line and I really don ’ t see a huge change . If anything , an improvement. ” Security cooperation has not always run smoothly , and Mexico , with its proud , nationalist leanings , has often chafed at what it views as U.S. intrusion in its affairs . Silva said after Vicente Fox became president in 2000 , Mexico gave less access to U.S. law enforcement . However , Fox ’ s successor , Felipe Calderon , was more willing to accept U.S. help , and Silva said he could even pick up the phone and call then-Attorney General Marisela Morales . The election of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto in 2012 represented a fresh set-back , with U.S. officials initially kept at arm ’ s length and a new attorney general appointed , Jesus Murillo Karam , who Silva called “ standoffish. ” Nonetheless , after a rocky start , relations soon warmed and U.S. intelligence , particularly the U.S . Marshals who track fugitives , became a key component in many of the high-profile busts that have taken place under Pena Nieto . “ It ’ s similar to what we were doing and receiving under Calderon , except that this current administration doesn ’ t talk about it or publicize that they ’ re working together , ” said one former DEA agent who worked on Mexican cases . After the victory of Trump , who has threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement , slap tariffs on U.S. firms manufacturing in Mexico and deport millions of illegal immigrants , some speculated years of hard-won security cooperation would fray as Mexico sought to show it wouldn ’ t be pushed around by the brash New Yorker . But behind the bluster , law enforcement officials from both countries said that was unlikely to happen , and that the situation could even improve if Trump , a law-and-order Republican who has repeatedly voiced his support for police and soldiers , focused more on combating Mexican cartels . “ The crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential , ” Trump said during his inauguration speech on Friday . “ This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. ” A Mexican anti-corruption official swatted away the notion that Mexico could shut out the United States on security issues . “ The government is going to continue the policy that it has always had of combating organized crime , ” he said . Vito Guardino , who worked for the DEA for 30 years , said the U.S. government used extradition as a yardstick to measure other countries ’ willingness to cooperate . But if the United States didn ’ t get what it wanted , he said , it found ways of forcing other nations to play ball , a reality unlikely to be lost on Mexico , which is heavily reliant on U.S. trade . For example , Guardino said that when Colombia stopped extraditing drug traffickers to the United States in the late 1980s , the U.S. government used a carrot-and-stick approach , threatening sanctions while drawing up the multibillion-dollar Plan Colombia . By that metric , Chapo ’ s removal represents a calculated show of faith on the part of Mexico , which has also signaled to Trump ’ s team it is open to reinforcing the northern border to curb drug smuggling and illegal migration . The high-stakes political tensions were , however , only one way of looking at things , Guardino and many others said . Relationships with foreign law enforcement officials often take years to build and rely on trust in dangerous circumstances .',\n",

In its appeal decision , OIP claimed that the FBI is not required to perform cross-reference searches unless the requester provides information sufficient to enable the FBI to determine with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [ the ] request , including , for example , the dates and locations of contacts between the subject of the request and the FBI , the subject s social security number , or other such information , the suit reads.However , BuzzFeed and Leopold contend in the complaint , Nothing in the FOIA statute requires a requester to provide this information before a cross-reference search must be conducted . As FBI and OIP are certainly aware , Andrew Breitbart was a well-known public figure and is easily identifiable by the FBI in conducting a cross-reference search , the suit reads . As the FBI and OIP are also aware , cross-reference searches frequently turn up records not located in main file searches . Via : THE WRAP',\n",
       " 'Malia s internship with pedophile Lena Dunham comes on the heels of her taxpayer funded European tour to London , Venice and Milan with her sister Sasha , Mooch and of course , Mooch s mom ( as no taxpayer funded vacation would be complete without ) .Dream job ? Malia Obama has landed a summer internship on the set of HBO s raunchy show Girls during which she ll be working with actress and proud feminist Lena Dunham , according to a report in US Weekly.Specifically , a source close to the television show s production team told the magazine of Malia , She s a fan , and she mentioned that to Lena [ Dunham ] when she came to the White House . I m not sure how long she ll be interning for . It s a bit of a trial thing for her . They ve known each other and discussed for a while . Lena and her get along great . The gig would make sense , as Malia was was photographed last week in Brooklyn drinking a soda on the set of Girls , though at the time it was uncertain whether she was working on the set or perhaps playing a guest role in an episode . Via : Red Alert PoliticsTruth Revolt : In her newly published collection of personal essays , Not That Kind of Girl , Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace , whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using anything a sexual predator might do . In one particularly unsettling passage , Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister s vagina . This was within the spectrum of things I did , she writes . anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying . In the collection of nonfiction personal accounts , Dunham describes using her little sister at times essentially as a sexual outlet , bribing her to kiss her for prolonged periods and even masturbating while she is in the bed beside her . But perhaps the most disturbing is an account she proudly gives of an episode that occurred when she was seven and her sister was one.Here s the full passage ( p. 158-9 ) : Do we all have uteruses ? I asked my mother when I was seven . Yes , she told me . We re born with them , and with all our eggs , but they start out very small . And they aren t ready to make babies until we re older . I look at my sister , now a slim , tough one-year-old , and at her tiny belly . I imagined her eggs inside her , like the sack of spider eggs in Charlotte s Web , and her uterus , the size of a thimble . Does her vagina look like mine ? I guess so , my mother said . Just smaller . One day , as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the best of me . Grace was sitting up , babbling and smiling , and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina . She didn t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.My mother came running . Mama , Mama ! Grace has something in there ! My mother didn t bother asking why I had opened Grace s vagina . This was within the spectrum of things I did . She just got on her knees and looked for herself . It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there . My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled , thrilled that her prank had been a success.Dunham describes the book as a work of nonfiction in which some names and identifying details have been changed . She also states that she considers herself an unreliable narrator , which gives her some wiggle room on the truth of her accounts . As National Review s Kevin D. Williamson notes , this passage is especially suspicious . The one-year old Grace s prank is supposedly done with the expectation of her older sister poking around in her genitals . There is no non-horrific interpretation of this episode . UpdateAfter Lena Dunham went on a self-described rage spiral in response to this article , which she called f * cking upsetting and disgusting , her lawyer sent a cease and desist letter to TruthRevolt threatening to sue us for millions of dollars if we did not pull the piece and post a retraction stating that this story was false . TruthRevolt refused.Monday , TruthRevolt editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro posted a response to the cease and desist letter , which includes more of the passages from her book upon which our assessment was based and argues that quoting a woman s book does not constitute a false story : Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book , but unfortunately for her and her attorneys , she wrote that book and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like .',\n",

       " 'ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE - Barack Obama starts his last trip to Asia on Saturday as U.S. president , aiming to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific but distracted by crises ranging from Brexit to the battle against Islamic State . With the clock ticking down on his presidency , Obama will attend a G20 summit in China , a visit that will underscore the challenges he has faced with a rising world power that is both an economic partner and strategic rival . His final meetings in the region with Chinese President Xi Jinping could set the tone for his White House successor , who will be elected in November and take office in January . Obama will seek to highlight his legacy of stronger ties with Southeast Asia , particularly during the first-ever U.S. presidential visit to Laos , and his success in elevating the issue of climate change on the world stage . But there will be few bright spots in talks with fellow world leaders , who are grappling with the sagging global economy , fallout from Britain ’ s vote to leave the European Union , increasing suspicion of globalization , the fight against Islamic State militants and territorial disputes in East Asia . During his past nine trips to Asia , Obama has sometimes been distracted by other international developments from the emphasis he sought to place on boosting U.S. military and economic ties to the fast-growing region , leading critics to doubt whether the U.S. commitment will last . The latest visit coincides with the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election , where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , his former secretary of state and co-architect of his Asia strategy , has opposed his Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal , raising concerns among the 12 nations in the pact . Republican nominee Donald Trump has alarmed allies like Japan and South Korea by suggesting they should pay more for their security and even develop their own nuclear weapons to protect against the threat posed by North Korea . Derek Chollet , a former defense adviser to Obama , said one of the challenges the United States faces is reassuring governments in Asia that the United States means what it says when it comes to rebalancing towards the region . “ Asia partners are suspicious that even if we really mean it , that we ’ re easily sidetracked , ” said Chollet , author of “ The Long Game , ” a book about Obama ’ s foreign policy . LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR OBAMA-XI TALKS Obama will start his visit on Saturday with China ’ s Xi . The leaders have forged cooperation on combating climate change and curbing Iran ’ s nuclear drive but have failed to narrow their countries ’ main differences . Irritants include U.S. accusations of Chinese cyber hacking , disputes over trade and Beijing ’ s pursuit of contested claims in the South China Sea . Michael Green , a top Asia adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush , said he did not expect the Obama-Xi meeting to yield much . “ No grand joint declaration as we saw early in the administration , no celebration - perhaps some agreements on climate change - but a pretty rough and scratchy relationship , ” Green said . Obama faces another tricky meeting when he holds talks with NATO ally Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan , with relations strained over strategy on Syria ’ s civil war and concerns about Erdogan ’ s crackdown on opponents after July ’ s failed coup . White House aides have left open the prospect of an informal encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin , which whom Obama is sharply at odds over Syria and Ukraine . China will closely watch Obama ’ s first meeting with brash new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte , slated for Tuesday at an East Asia summit in Laos . In July , the Philippines , with U.S. backing , won a challenge against China ’ s South China Sea claims at an international arbitration court . Despite the longtime U.S.-Philippines alliance , Duterte recently insulted the U.S. ambassador , calling him a “ gay son of a whore. ” Evan Medeiros , Obama ’ s former top Asia adviser , said such comments plus Duterte ’ s skepticism about the U.S. relationship meant that trust needed to be rebuilt . The White House has said Obama will not pull his punches over human rights concerns , which include thousands of extra-judicial killings since Duterte took office two months ago , according to date released this week . Strains with Duterte could add to Obama ’ s difficulties in forging a united front on the South China Sea with Southeast Asian partners . China may see an opportunity to “ drive a wedge ” between the United States and Philippines as Beijing seeks a bilateral arrangement with Manila over the South China Sea , Medeiros said . Western diplomats in Beijing , however , said the Chinese government had its own difficulties reading Duterte . “ He seems to change his mind every 24 hours , ” said one senior Western envoy , referring to Duterte ’ s China policy .',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW - A Russian court ordered the detention of a man on Saturday on suspicion of trying to intimidate cinemas into not showing a new film about the country s last tsar , Russia s news agencies said . Police said earlier they had opened a criminal case following a series of arson attacks in protest over the film Matilda by award-winning director Alexei Uchitel . The film tells the story of a love affair between the tsar , Nicholas II , and half-Polish ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya , who described the relationship in her memoirs . Interfax cited the court s spokeswoman as saying the man detained was Alexander Kalinin , leader of a radical religious group called Christian State - Holy Rus , on suspicion of pressuring the cinemas not to screen the movie . The court ordered that he be held in custody until Nov. 22 , without charge . Christian State vowed to set cinemas on fire if they screened Matilda and a series of arson attacks connected with the film have been reported across the country . Matilda is to be released internationally in late October despite protests from religious conservatives who are offended by what they regard as a disrespectful depiction of a man the Russian Orthodox Church regards as a martyr . Some cinemas have said they will not be showing the film because of threats that they had received . A criminal case has been opened in connection with the fact ( the cinemas ) were forced not to show the film under the threat of violence against the spectators and causing harm and damage to the cinemas owners , the police said in statement , not naming the film or those detained or charged . The police opened the case in connection with the arson attacks related to Matilda , TASS news agency reported , citing a police source . On Thursday police said they had detained four men , including Kalinin , in connection with an arson attack related to the film . Three of the men had been charged with arson , including their alleged role in setting fire to two cars parked outside the office of Uchitel s lawyer . Other violent acts of protest against the film have included an arson attack on Uchitel s studio and a man driving a car into the facade of a cinema .',\n",

The problem with that argument is that it assumes the minority Jewish population would have been able to stand up to the powerful German military , which included the brutal SS.When Ben Carson made the same claim last year , Politifact ripped him a new one by pointing out that the Nazis actually loosened gun laws significantly for the population , but restricted Jews from owning firearms.German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis . Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized . But for most German citizens , the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened , not tightened.Second , a lack of guns was not the issue . If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis , they could have . But they didn t.In other words , the only form of gun control the Nazis really liked was keeping Jews from owning them.But even if the Jews were well-armed and willing to fight back , the fact remains that the German population supported the Nazis and Hitler had powerful military forces under his command . It is highly unlikely that the Jews could have prevented the Holocaust by themselves.Despite the facts , Nugent wrote another rant aimed at those who criticized his first post , referring to Jews who don t agree with him as Nazis in disguise . // < !

This is nothing short of conspiratorial anti-Semitism . Regardless of one s views on gun control , this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality . It should go without saying that anti-Semitism has no place in the gun control debate . You should be ashamed for promoting anti-Semitic content , and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message . We hope you will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet . Ted Nugent talks tough about his dad , but apparently the apple fell far from the tree . Let s not forget that Nugent dodged the Vietnam war by pooping in his pants.And this isn t the first time Nugent has attacked a people that suffered through genocide . Nugent once referred to Native Americans as unclean vermin who don t qualify as people . And let s not forget his anthem to child rape that must drive family values Republicans wild.Also , keep in mind that Ted Cruz is Nugent s favorite Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race . Perhaps someone should ask Cruz how he feels about what Nugent thinks about Jews who support reasonable laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. Because that s what we re really talking about here better background checks that most Americans , including NRA members , support . Nobody in our government has suggested seizing the guns of every American . And there have certainly been no suggestions of banning certain ethnic minorities from owning firearms . This is all in the imaginations of conservatives who have used such claims to push a guns everywhere agenda that has only opened our society up to more gun deaths and mass shootings than ever before.But if anyone should have their guns taken from them , it s Ted Nugent , considering the fact that he has openly called for the assassination of President Obama and other government officials on several occasions .

       " 'Donald Trump delivered a major f * ck you to his fellow conservatives when he spoke out against North Carolina s controversial and transphobic bathroom bill and said he would be perfectly fine with transgender people using whatever bathroom they wanted to.Trump made these surprising comments during Thursday s NBC Today town hall as host Willie Geist asked the Republican frontrunner questions from Twitter users . Geist asked Trump , Mr. Trump , please be specific . Tell us your views on LGBT , how you plan to be inclusive as president . Speak about North Carolina bathroom law in particular . Inclusivity is something Trump has completely strayed away from during his campaign , and he s managed to successfully insult and exclude nearly every minority possible . But this time , Trump s answer surprised everyone . Stating that North Carolina s bathroom law had caused a lot of problems , he said : North Carolina did something that was very strong , and they are paying a big price and there s a lot of problems . North Carolina , what they are going through with all of the business that s leaving and the strife and that s on both sides . Leave it the way it is . There have been very few complaints the way it is . People go , they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate , there has been so little trouble . This is one of the VERY few times that Trump is mostly right . There have not only been few complaints there have actually been ZERO instances of sexual assaults or other issues when transgender individuals were allowed to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity . Still , that was one of the main arguments that North Carolina Republicans were using to get this bathroom bill passed.When Geist asked Trump if he had employed transgender individuals at his company , Trump replied that he wasn t certain , but he probably had transgender people working for him . Geist pressed him further : So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom , you d be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses ? And Trump stuck it to the GOP one last time : That is correct . Also speaking against the creation of new bathrooms specifically for transgender people , Trump said it would be too expensive , and that I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way . You can watch the interview below : Trump has previously held more liberal views than conservative , and he loves to stir up controversy whenever he can . One thing is for sure the GOP is NOT going to appreciate this.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images',\n",

Leaders of Iran , where opposition to Israel and support for the Palestinian cause has been central to foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution , have denounced last week s announcement by the U.S. president , including a plan to move the U.S. embassy to the city . The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state . ( Trump s ) step will hasten the destruction of the Zionist regime and will double the unity of Muslims , Iran s defense minister , Brigadier General Amir Hatami , said on Monday , according to state media . The army s chief of staff , General Mohammad Baqeri , said Trump s foolish move could be seen as the beginning of a new intifada , or Palestinian uprising . Iran has long supported a number of anti-Israeli militant groups , including the military wing of Lebanon-based Hezbollah , which the deputy commander of Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards , Brigadier General Hossein Salami , said was stronger than the Zionist regime . Similarly , Qassem Soleimani , the head of the branch of the Guards that oversees operations outside of Iran s borders pledged the Islamic Republic s complete support for Palestinian Islamic resistance movements after phone calls with commanders from Islamic Jihad and the Izz al-Deen Qassam brigades , the armed wing of the Hamas movement , on Monday according to Sepah News , the news site of the Guards .

       " 'President Obama is currently in his final year as Commander-in-Chief while Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party . 70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Donald Trump while 56 percent of women voted for President Obama in 2012 . And it s not hard to see why.An incredible video by Buzzfeed compares how President Obama has treated women versus how Donald Trump has treated women.While President Obama has focused on making sure women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys and appreciates the role that women have played in making this nation strong , Donald Trump objectifies women , judges them based on their looks , and considers them to be baby-makers who can be cast aside for a different woman.The video begins with Trump telling Celebrity Apprentice contestant Brande Roderick that she must be a pretty picture , you dropping to your knees . President Obama is then shown talking about his objection to his daughters not being able to have the same opportunities as somebody s sons . That s unacceptable , he tells the audience.Then Trump is shown telling a female reporter that she wouldn t have a job if she wasn t beautiful.At the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation , President Obama spoke of how that we have to speak louder than the voices telling our girls that they re not good enough . That they ve got to look a certain way , or they got ta act a certain way . It continues this way throughout the video . Trump makes a negative remark about women while President Obama praises women and fights for their future.Here s the video via Facebook : That s really the choice we face in 2016 . Do we want to elect a president who will fight for women or do we want Trump , a man who has shown utter contempt for women and only notices them if they look like a super model . Because if we want a president who respects and fights for women like President Obama , the logical choice this November would be whichever Democrat ends up on the ticket opposite Trump.Hillary Clinton is taking aim at history as she seeks to become the first female President of the United States . Human rights are women s rights , and women s rights are human rights , she said at the U.N. 4th World Conference on Women Plenary Session in 1995 . Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely and the right to be heard . We need to understand that there is no formula for how women should lead their lives , she continued . That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family . Every woman deserves the chance to realize her God-given potential . Here s the video of her full speech via YouTube.Bernie Sanders is also pursuing the presidency . His chances at capturing the nomination are waning but should he win the nomination he would also be a good choice for women in November.Like Clinton , Sanders has fought for women s rights throughout his career . As the longtime senator from Vermont , Sanders has made women s issues a major part of his policy agenda.Sanders explained his efforts to elevate women to the Washington Post in September . You re looking at somebody who s made a cornerstone , a key part of my campaign , the need for at least three months of family and medical leave ; somebody who is fighting to raise the minimum wage over a two year period to $ 15 an hour , which will benefit everybody , but women actually more than men ; somebody who regards it as enormously important that we fight for pay equity for women ; somebody who believes that our child care system is a disaster today and that we need to have the best childcare/pre-K system in the world , making it universal and affordable.So I think if people look at my record , I think they will see somebody who has had a lifelong record of support for the women s movement and women s rights . Like Clinton , Sanders also supports a woman s right to choose . When you tell a woman that she can not control her own body , that s extremism , he wrote on Twitter . Let s say it loud and clear : women control their bodies , not the government . In short , the contrast between Trump and the Democratic Party couldn t be more clear . Trump is a serial womanizer who constantly spews despicable sexist remarks that should automatically disqualify him from running for president . But so far , conservatives seem to have no problem with Trump s anti-women beliefs and that is why ads like the one below will continue to haunt Trump s campaign.Democratic candidates , meanwhile , want women to be equal and be treated with respect and dignity just like President Obama has been pushing for over the last eight years . And that s why we need another eight years or more of a Democrat in the White House.Featured image via screenshot',\n",

That s why his two runs at the Republican nomination for president have been so laughably short . But those efforts did earn him something in the end : An appointment to an office he said he wanted to abolish , by the guy that beat him by publicly commenting on how dumb he is .. @ GovernorPerry failed on the border .

That fear , of course , is unfounded , because Rick Perry totally thought the DoE meant he was in charge of our oil . You can see why his brain might go there . He s from Texas , so he may have imagined himself the perfect selection as Oilman-in-Chief . Maybe he was confused by terrifying phrases like foreign energy or energy independence , which do indeed mean oil and gas.The guy in charge of those is actually Ryan Zinke , head of the Department of the Interior .

       " 'House Speaker Paul Ryan sold his soul the day he endorsed Donald Trump to be president of the United States . It was clear that he was just being a spineless , cowardly weasel when he did so , as he did it under cover of a big policy speech by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Ever since then , Ryan s relationship with Trump has been frosty at best , and they have never appeared on stage together.During a weekly press briefing , Ryan got the one question everyone has been asking : Why hasn t Donald Trump released his tax returns ? This is especially pressing right now , as Newsweek just printed a damning story that shows that should Donald Trump become president , the Trump Organization s rather dubious web of international ties would endanger the national security of the United States of America . With that revelation , it is even more imperative than ever that the American electorate sees Trump s tax returns . Hell , even George W. Bush s ethics lawyer said that these ties are a , quote , serious problem . Therefore , Ryan finally caved and said Trump s returns need to be made public . First , he referenced his own releasing of his taxes when he ran for Vice President : I did release my returns . I ll defer to Donald Trump as to when he thinks the appropriate time to release his returns . I know he is under audit , and he has an opinion on when to release those and I ll defer to him on that . He then hedged , though , because he is a coward who is afraid of upsetting Trump s supporters , and said : I released mine . I think he should release his . I ll leave it to him when to do it . No , Speaker Ryan , you need to get forceful with this . We need the returns NOW . With all of the shadiness surrounding Trump s business dealings and ties to nefarious characters around the world , this is vital information for the nation and world to know . Trump is trying to run the clock out on this one , to keep the voting public from knowing just what he gets up to . Do your job , and DEMAND Trump s tax returns.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump is moving the United States closer to a war with China over some tiny islands.The relationship between the United States has been cordial and peaceful for decades now , but Trump plans to change all that . For someone who claims that our military is depleted , Trump sure has no problem putting our country on the brink of war.China is currently making claims to islands in the South China Sea , which is an international body of water . The matter could probably be settled through diplomacy , but Trump has chosen to bully China instead . And he is inviting a catastrophic war in the process.According to Reuters , The comments at a briefing from White House spokesman Sean Spicer signaled a sharp departure from years of cautious U.S. handling of China s assertive pursuit of territory claims in Asia , just days after Trump took office on Friday . The U.S. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there , Spicer said when asked if Trump agreed with comments by his Secretary of State nominee , Rex Tillerson , on Jan. 11 that China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested South China Sea . It s a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper , then yeah , we re going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country , he said.Tillerson s remarks at his Senate confirmation hearing prompted Chinese state media to say the United States would need to wage war to bar China s access to the islands where it has built military-length air strips and installed weapons systems.The strong language suggests Trump is considering military action or a naval blockade to keep the islands out of Chinese hands , but even Chinese state media has warned that such action would lead to war between the two nations.And that would be a catastrophe . Not only would this be a war between two nuclear powers , it would be a war between the two largest economies in the world , which means a war between China and the United States would have serious global ramifications.But war is apparently what Trump is thinking about as he has repeatedly treated China with antagonism since before Election Day.And Americans should not expect our allies to help us either . If Trump starts a war with China , America would be on its own . Our troops would be fighting and dying because of Trump s fragile ego . The deficit and the national debt would also skyrocket , especially since Trump has promised Corporate America that he will cut their taxes in half , which would deprive the government of revenues to keep our military strong . That means Trump will get the revenues from the middle class and the poor.China s military and navy are improving rapidly , and they are the most populous nation on Earth . That means Trump would have a reinstate the military draft he himself dodged during the Vietnam War to get enough soldiers to put on the front lines . Even thinking about a military confrontation is insane.The longer Trump is allowed to remain in office , the more dangerous he becomes . This country is now on a path to a war that will cripple our nation and Trump doesn t give a damn because he thinks it makes him look tough . In reality , it just makes him look like an idiot.Featured Image : Spencer Platt/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'BERLIN - The German government should revoke landing rights for Kuwait Airways given its ban on Israeli passengers , a senior Justice Department official said on Friday , saying such discrimination was intolerable . Christian Lange , parliamentary state secretary in the ministry , appealed to Chancellor Angela Merkel to personally advocate a ban on Kuwait Airways operations in Germany . A German court ruled on Thursday that the airline had the right to refuse to carry an Israeli passenger due to his nationality , a verdict that Jewish groups said condoned anti-Semitism . Lange told Merkel in the letter that he had received countless phone calls from members of the Jewish community and from others in Israel , expressing shock about the court ruling , made just days after Germany solemnly marked the anniversary of the Nov. 9 , 1938 Nazi pogroms against the Jews . We can not say Never again at a remembrance ceremony , but then remain silent when activists in Germany call for a boycott of Israel , or , as in this case , when an airline refuses to carry Israeli citizens , Lange said . Especially the German government must make clear that we reject this form of discrimination and hate , and that we stand by the side of our Israeli friends , he told the chancellor . The Lawfare Project , the legal group that represented the plaintiff in the case , has vowed to appeal against the ruling . To see a Jewish person banned from exercising his freedoms in Germany in 2017 is chilling enough . To see that discrimination whitewashed and legitimized by a German judge is grotesque , said the group s executive director , Brooke Goldstein . Deputy German Foreign Minister Michael Roth also criticized the airline s policy , telling Die Welt newspaper that he had contacted the Kuwaiti ambassador in Germany about the issue . German Transport Minister Christian Schmidt told Bild newspaper that it was not acceptable to discriminate against airline passengers because of their nationality , and said the German government would address the matter with the Kuwaiti government . This requires contacts at the ministerial level , Schmidt told the newspaper in an interview to be published on Saturday . We will do all we can within our legal means to prevent something like this in the future , Schmidt told the paper . There was no immediate response to a request for comment emailed to the airline .',\n",

The most surprising finding being that Clinton has 28 % of registered Republican voters voting for her.Bonier said : We see this race as an eight point spread in favor of Secretary Clinton . 48-40 . Which really is challenging the conventional wisdom of what we ve seen so far . I will say , in what we re seeing , as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network , a lot of the vote in Florida has already been cast and elsewhere . As of this morning , over 3.6 million votes have been cast , and so , what s unique about this survey is our ability to actually poll people who have voted and see where they are . There s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party , but really no sense given of how they re voting.Really what s fueling , honestly , this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for Secretary Clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered Republican voters . So , what we re seeing in this survey is winning 28 % of registered Republicans who have already cast a ballot in Florida . This certainly doesn t look too good for Trump , but it s still early and the election is still a week a way , so who s really to know . BUT it s definitely looking good for Clinton thus far .

       " 'If the title of this book was White Skin Privilege you would likely find it in just about every college campus library or school book store . Conversely , it s highly unlikely that you ll find the Black Skin Privilege and the American Dream book on any college or high school reading lists . After all , discrimination is a one-way street and as usual , the left gets to determine who s being discriminated against and who s guilty of discrimination In 2013 , conservative writers David Horowitz and John Perazzo released a Kindle pamphlet titled , Black Skin Privilege and the American Dream , and today I want to give you an inside look courtesy Frontpage Magazine.In the pamphlet , the authors argued that , in their obsessive quest to find evidence of illusory white skin privilege , the left instead winded up creating black skin privilege . Its effects can be seen in the presumption of guilt on the part of innocent whites ( think Duke lacrosse team ) on the basis of their skin color , while guilty blacks ( think O.J . Simpson ) are often presumed innocent , the authors wrote.Think also of Mike Brown and Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson . The left turned Wilson into a bogeyman of alleged racial terror , while they portrayed Brown as an innocent gentle giant . Not surprisingly , the evidence eventually vindicated Wilson and proved without a doubt that the real villain had been Brown all along . Blacks can commit racist attacks on whites certain that civil rights activists who sift the news obsessively for black victims will either not notice or dismiss such attacks as a form of delayed justice for the historical oppression of black people , the writers added.Indeed . I try to cover as much racial crime as possible , but frankly , too many stories of blacks assaulting whites appear on my feed for me to legitimately address them . If you want to know more about such crimes , I suggest you follow Colin Flaherty on YouTube : https : //youtu.be/tMsJ1wc7mTwHere is an excerpt from the book : The result of such prejudice there is no better word for it is the creation of an optical illusion of deeply embedded , if largely invisible , white racism that creates vast numbers of black victims when the social facts show quite a different situation , the authors added.According to FBI crime data released earlier this year , whites and Hispanics are far more likely to be killed by a black person than a black person is to be killed by either a white or Hispanic person.Alas , these sorts of facts are suppressed ( or shrugged off ) by the media and civil rights activists dedicated to creating a one-sided and propagandistic narrative of race in the United States . As a result , we live in an age where every black criminal is automatically assumed to be a victim , while every white victim is automatically assumed to be a perpetrator.It s sad , but it s all part of Obama s America Via : DownTrend',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Senate Republicans on Thursday crushed a Democratic blockade of President Donald Trump ’ s U.S. Supreme Court nominee in a fierce partisan brawl , approving a rule change dubbed the “ nuclear option ” to allow for conservative judge Neil Gorsuch ’ s confirmation by Friday . With ideological control of the country ’ s highest court at stake , the Republican-led Senate voted 52-48 along party lines to change its long-standing rules in order to prohibit a procedural tactic called a filibuster against Supreme Court nominees . That came after Republicans failed by a 55-45 tally to muster the 60-vote super-majority needed to end the Democratic filibuster that had sought to deny Gorsuch confirmation to the lifetime post . The Senate ’ s action cleared the way to confirm Gorsuch by simple majority on Friday , with a final vote expected by late morning . Republicans control the Senate 52-48 . The rule change was called the “ nuclear option ” because it was considered an extreme break with Senate tradition . Trump had encouraged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to “ go nuclear. ” Confirmation of Gorsuch would represent Trump ’ s first major victory since taking office on Jan. 20 , after setbacks on healthcare legislation and the blocking of his order that sought to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States . Senate confirmation of Gorsuch , a Colorado-based federal appeals could judge , would restore the nine-seat court ’ s 5-4 conservative majority , enable Trump to leave an indelible mark on America ’ s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president . Gorsuch , 49 , could be expected to serve for decades . “ This will be the first and last partisan filibuster of the Supreme Court , ” McConnell said on the Senate floor , accusing Democrats of trying to inflict political damage on Trump and to keep more conservatives from joining the high court . “ In 20 or 30 or 40 years , we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court , a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our founders intended for these institutions : principles of bipartisanship , moderation and consensus , ” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor . Schumer ridiculed McConnell ’ s contention that the Democratic action was unprecedented . He noted that the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama ’ s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland for the same seat that Trump selected Gorsuch to fill . With three of the court ’ s justices 78 or older , Trump told reporters he hoped to appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices , a move likely to make it overwhelmingly conservative . “ In fact , under a certain scenario there could even be more than that , ” Trump said aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting with China ’ s president in Florida , adding that the Senate rule change would not alter how he picks court nominees . A conservative-majority court is more likely to support broad gun rights , an expansive view of religious liberty , abortion regulations and Republican-backed voting restrictions , while opposing curbs on political spending . The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years . A 60-vote threshold giving the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments . In the final procedural vote that paved the way for confirmation , three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indiana ’ s Joe Donnelly , West Virginia ’ s Joe Manchin and North Dakota ’ s Heidi Heitkamp - broke with their party and voted with Republicans to bring about a confirmation vote , although they opposed the rule change . A fourth Democrat , Michael Bennet , who represents Gorsuch ’ s home state of Colorado , voted with Republicans on Thursday ’ s first procedural vote to bring debate to a close . But he stuck with fellow Democrats in opposing the final vote to end the filibuster , the one that succeeded following the rule change . Republicans have called Gorsuch superbly qualified and one of the nation ’ s most distinguished appellate judges . Democrats accused him of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream , favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions , and displaying insufficient independence from Trump . What Republicans did to Obama ’ s nominee Garland was worse than a filibuster , Schumer said . Schumer said Republicans denied “ the constitutional prerogative of a president with 11 months left in his term. ” “ The nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick Garland , ” Democratic Senator Richard Durbin said on the Senate floor . “ What we face today is the fallout. ” McConnell blamed the escalation of fights over judicial nominees on the Democrats and their opposition starting three decades ago to nominees made by Republican former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush . Experts said eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments could make it more likely that presidents , with little incentive to choose centrist justices who could attract support from the other party , will pick ideologically extreme nominees in the future . Ending the filibuster also would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party . The filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s . While Democrats opposed the rule change and accused Republicans of a power grab , it was their party that first resorted to the nuclear option when they controlled the Senate in 2013 . In the face of Republican filibusters of Obama appointments , they barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices but still allowed it for Supreme Court nominees and legislation . The Republican-backed rule change maintains the ability to filibuster legislation .',\n",

       " 'On February 25 , 1994 , Israeli-Zionist terrorist Barch Goldstein walked into the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Palestinian city of Khalil ( Hebron ) and executed 29 kneeling Palestinian worshipers and wounded another 129 . Soon after , protests broke out in the city and at least 20 more Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers guarding the illegal Jewish settlers Israel implanted in the city . Israel also imposed a permanent closure on Al-Shuhada Street , once a bustling strip of Palestinian businesses . The street is the main road leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs and today , only Jewish Israelis are allowed access to the street , turning the area , which was once the heart of the city , into a virtual ghost town.As Palestinians mark 22 years since the massacre at the mosque and the closure of Al-Shuhada Street , Amnesty International is calling on Israel to lift their military restrictions and collective punishment of Palestinians , a war crime under international law : Since October 2015 , as violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories ( OPT ) and Israel has surged , the Israeli authorities have drastically increased the arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on movement imposed on Palestinians in and around Hebron s Old City , declaring parts of it a closed military zone . This has further entrenched and exacerbated a pattern of long-standing violations of the rights to freedom of movement , work , health and education of Palestinians in Hebron , especially tens of thousands residing or working in or near the Old City . The arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions , which are not applied to the Israeli Jews living in the illegal settlements in and around the city , constitute collective punishment and violate international humanitarian law . Furthermore , Palestinian and international human rights defenders , including monitors , have been prevented from accessing the areas of al-Shuhada Street and el Rumeida , and are constantly harassed by Israeli forces and settlers . In typical fashion of tyrannical states , Israel has also attacked human rights activists who have protested Israel s brutal policies toward the Palestinians . Amnesty International states : International activists and human rights defenders , who have played a crucial role for many years in documenting Israeli violations against Palestinians living in Hebron , have also been harassed and attacked by Israeli forces and settlers , and prevented from entering the area designated a closed military zone . Activists from the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) told Amnesty International in October that Israeli settlers had physically attacked them frequently , including in the presence of Israeli forces , who did not act to stop the attacks . The ISM also reported that the Israeli police arrested two international activists on 3 November 2015 at the request of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint the two activists were observing . The two were released , ISM said , when they agreed to leave the city for a week despite the Israeli police telling them there was no evidence against them . The report ends by pointing to Israel s colonies or what are typically referred to as settlements , which are illegal under international law , as the main source of tension in the area . Israel has built colonies and an infrastructure exclusively for Jews , stealing Palestinian land and then killing them when they resist Israel s Orwellian experiment . Amnesty International states : The presence of illegal settlements in and around Hebron is both the cause of the long-standing human rights crisis in the city , and the primary reason for the escalating violence seen there in recent months . The settlements were established in violation of international law , their presence has resulted in grave violations of Palestinians human rights over many years , and Israel s settlement policy is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . Instead of continuing the discriminatory measures and actions that compound an illegal situation and violate Palestinians human rights , Israel must evacuate the Israeli civilians living in the illegal settlements in and around Hebron , as well as elsewhere in the OPT .

       " 'PALERMO , Italy - Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi looked poised on Monday for a stunning political comeback as his rightist bloc claimed victory in an election in Sicily that puts it in pole position for a national vote due by next May . The regional Sicilian ballot , held on Sunday , was seen as a dry run for the nationwide election , with many of the island s problems reflecting those of the country as a whole - high unemployment , a debt mountain and sluggish economic growth . An influx of migrants , many of whom arrive in Sicily after being rescued in the Mediterranean , was also a key issue . With all of the votes counted , a center-right bloc backed by the four-times prime minister was more than 5 percentage points ahead of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement , with the center left , which governs at the national level , a distant third . Sicily , just as I asked , has chosen the path of real , serious , constructive change , based on honesty , competence and experience , the 81-year-old said in a video posted on Facebook . Nello Musumeci , the center right s candidate for governor of the island , had 39.8 percent of the vote , while the 5-Star s Giancarlo Cancelleri had 34.7 percent . The center left s Fabrizio Micari was lagging on 18.7 percent . The result puts Berlusconi back on the political map after years of sex scandals and graft allegations which had seemed to have reduced the billionaire media mogul to a spent force . Berlusconi can not run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction . But he hopes the European Court of Human Rights overturns this ban when it reviews his case later this year , which would pave the way for a possible national challenge . He returned to the fray after open-heart surgery last year and campaigned actively in Sicily . Even if the courts deny him the chance to run , he would be an influential figure should the center right capture power again nationally . The result on the island deals a stinging blow to another former prime minister , Matteo Renzi , head of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) , which is locked in feuding with erstwhile leftist partners . After a raft of vote setbacks in recent years , Renzi has many critics inside the PD who may now try to mount a challenge to his leadership . Defiant in its defeat , the anti-system 5-Star Movement vowed to reach national government next year , and its leader Luigi Di Maio declared the PD politically dead . Opinion polls suggest the center right will win next year s national vote , but a recent change to the electoral law is likely to stop any one bloc winning an absolute majority of seats , resulting in political gridlock . Sicily is traditionally a center-right stronghold which was poached by the PD in 2012 thanks to splits in the conservative bloc . This time , Berlusconi reunited the coalition behind a widely respected leader with a far-right background . Berlusconi s allies , the Brothers of Italy and the Northern League , reaped rewards with anti-immigrant campaigns , suggesting this will remain high on the agenda for the national vote . From Sicily we will demonstrate that this is a winning model that can triumph at a national level , said Giorgia Meloni , the leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party which is the junior partner in the center-right alliance . The centre-left government has moved this year to shut down the flow of migrants from Libya after more than 600,000 , mainly Africans , reached Italy over the past four years . But the issue has dented support for the center left , which has further damaged itself by falling prey to ferocious schisms . The maverick 5-Star , founded by comedian Beppe Grillo , had campaigned relentlessly for months in Sicily , looking to take charge of its first region after a string of successes in municipal ballots in recent years , including in Rome and Turin . Di Maio said the party had been penalized in Sicily by low turnout - a record of fewer than half of those eligible cast a vote , showing flagging interest in politics in Italy following years of economic downturn . In two or three months I think many of those who abstained will regret not going to vote , Di Maio said , insisting that if turnout had been 3 or 4 points higher it could have tilted the result in the movement s favor . Despite losing to the center right , the 5-Star Movement s result was a leap from 2012 , when its candidate won only 18 percent of the vote in the regional polls . Investors are worried 5-Star might win control of the country . The party bases its appeal mainly on a campaign against corruption and vested interests in Italy , but it has pulled back from a pledge to hold a referendum on continued membership of the euro . Markets were little changed on Monday .',\n",
       " '( Advisory : This story contains content that may offend some readers ) By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN , Texas - Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday distanced the party from its newly elected leader in Travis County , a self-described caustic tweeter and author of political conspiracy books who says he uses sexually explicit language on social media to educate people . Robert Morrow , 51 , beat the current Republican Party chairman in the county in Tuesday ’ s primary , causing some officials in the party to tell local media they are seeing if they can prevent him from taking office . “ Robert Morrow in no way speaks for the Republican Party or its values . He can not adequately represent the Travis County GOP , ” said John Wittman , a spokesman for the Texas governor . Morrow said on his Twitter feed shortly after his win , “ I am the face of the Re-Pube-Licking Party , ” and posted an idea for a pornographic video involving former first lady Barbara Bush . “ I put out caustic and inflammatory tweets because I am trying to educate people , ” he said in a interview , adding he provides Internet links to support his arguments . Morrow boasted he did not spend a penny on his campaign and probably won because his name appeared first on the ballot . Travis County , which contains the Texas capital Austin , is one of the few Democratic strongholds in a heavily Republican state . But party officials may be over a barrel in that there is little they can do to remove someone who has been duly elected . Some party leaders have floated the idea of starting a new county organization for the Republican Party and leaving Morrow to preside over an empty operation . “ They are neutered gerbils , ” Morrow said . “ The people have spoken and Morrow is the face of the Travis County Republican Party. ” Morrow , a Ted Cruz supporter who has also written conspiracy theory books about the Clintons and the John F. Kennedy assassination , has made defamatory remarks about Republican leaders in the state and the current crop of presidential candidates . “ The reason I ran for chair of the Travis County Republican Party is because I was so disgusted with the involvement of the Bush crime family in national politics and Republican Party politics , ” he said . Andy Hogue , the communications director for the Travis County Republican Party , said the new county chairman does not take office until June 13 . “ At this time there are many personal opinions but no official courses of action or statements , ” Hogue said .

Trump s assault on truth and logic , far from hurting him , made him stronger . His appeal part hope , part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics . Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world , from Britain to the Philippines , and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands , all of the time .

Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before , same people , same promises , same patterns ? Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweeting but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.Time is correct that Trump has perhaps had the greatest impact on the news , but one must wonder why they would choose to reward the bigotry and hate he encouraged and continues to encourage in their annual marketing gimmick . Normally , this would be a run-of-the-mill honor , even for a dictator ( Time called Hitler the greatest threatening force that the democratic , freedom-loving world faces today in their 1938 article ) , but Trump thrives off of the attention and Time should have made the decision not to enable him.Featured image via Time\",\n",
       " '- It was an awkward coalition riven by political and sectarian differences , facing an elusive , fanatical enemy dug into an urban maze of narrow streets and alleyways . So , could Iraq s government really deliver on its vow to vanquish Islamic State ? In the end , the army , Shi ite Muslim paramilitaries and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters mustered rare unity to end Islamic State s reign of terror in Iraq s second city Mosul , seat of the ultra-hardline Sunni insurgents caliphate . Baghdad s victory in July 2017 after nine months of fighting was the coup de grace for the caliphate and came three years after a jihadist juggernaut seized one third of Iraq . But even with supportive U.S. air strikes , Baghdad s triumph came at a devastating cost for the once-vibrant , multicultural city in northern Iraq and the surrounding region . When Islamic State militants first arrived in Mosul in June 2014 after sweeping aside crumbling Iraqi army units , many Mosul residents initially welcomed them . The militants were Sunni Muslims , like many in Mosul who had accused the forces of then-Shi ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of widespread sectarian abuses . Islamic State consequently presented itself as Mosul s savior . But as jihadists brandishing AK-47 assault rifles began imposing an Islamist doctrine even more brutal and mediaeval than al Qaeda , its popularity soon faded . Maliki s successor , Haider al-Abadi , had long been seen as an ineffective leader who could not make tough decisions . However , a U.S.-backed campaign against IS in Mosul offered Abadi a chance to emerge as a steely statesman capable of taking on a group that had terrorized a sprawling city with beheadings in public squares while staging deadly attacks in the West . Just smoking one cigarette , an act IS saw as anti-Islamic , earned you dozens of lashes . Children were used as informers . Women in minority communities were turned into sex slaves . But taking back Mosul was never going to be easy . Long before the first shot was fired , Abadi and his advisers and military commanders had to tread cautiously , taking into account sectarian and ethnic sensitivities that could splinter the united front he urgently needed to establish . Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence agencies had recruited informers inside Mosul , from ex-soldiers and army officers to taxi drivers , who would face instant execution if caught . Even if an alliance of convenience was struck , glossing over sectarian splits , Mosul itself posed formidable physical obstacles . Key districts consisted of ancient little streets and alleyways inaccessible to tanks and armored vehicles , and they were so densely populated that U.S.-led coalition air strikes risked heavy civilian casualties . So , street by street , house by house , fighting was unavoidable . Such challenges first popped up in Mosul s hinterland as Kurdish forces slowly advanced against fierce IS resistance . In one village , a single IS sniper hunkered down in a house held up hundreds of Kurdish fighters , the U.S. special forces advising them and 40 of their vehicles . Eventually , his rifle went silent after three air strikes on the house . As pro-government forces inched forward , the United Nations warned of a possible humanitarian disaster and expressed fear that jihadists could seize civilians for use as human shields , and gun down anyone trying to escape . IS fighters both Iraqis and foreigners - were experts at carrying out suicide bombings and assembling homemade bombs . Many houses were booby-trapped . Iraqi military commanders had to factor these lurking perils into their gameplan . In interviews , IS insurgents shed light on what Iraqi forces were up against . They were quite open about their ideology and what they were willing to do to transform the Middle East . One man said he had used rape as a weapon of war against more than 200 women from Iraqi minorities , and had killed 500 people . After months of grueling fighting , Iraqi forces finally attained the outskirts of Mosul , but any celebrations were premature . Bombs littered dusty roads . Car bombs were exploding . A Mosul resident explained that his child no longer flinched as explosions shook his street because many people , including the young , had grown numb to the daily bloodshed . Each side resorted to desperate measures to gain an edge . In north Mosul , people walked by fly-infested , bloated corpses of militants who had been left on roadsides for two weeks . Iraqi soldiers explained that the stinking bodies had been left there to send a clear message to residents - don t join IS or you will suffer the same fate . Caught in the middle were civilians who had suffered under the IS reign of terror for three years and were now wondering if they would survive a relentless battle to liberate them . Parents waited patiently after weeks of fighting for a largely unknowable right moment to make a dash for Iraqi government lines , clutching their children , risking a run-in with jihadists from places as far away as Chechnya . As much of east and west Mosul was pulverized by coalition air strikes or IS truck and car bombs , the city was reduced to row after row of collapsed or gutted housing . In the end , IS suffered its most decisive defeat and watched their self-proclaimed caliphate evaporate in Iraq , then in Syria as Kurdish-led forces retook Raqqa , IS s urban stronghold there . But those victories will be followed by tough questions about the future of both Iraq and Syria . Preserving the shaky understanding forged between the different communities in the run-up to the Mosul campaign will be essential to saving Iraq as a state in the future . It did not take long for the Mosul coalition to fray . In October , Iraqi forces dislodged Kurdish Peshmerga fighters from the oil city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas and Baghdad imposed curbed air travel to and from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in retaliation for a Kurdish independence referendum held in northern Iraq in September . The battle for Raqqa , which became IS s operational base in Syria , had a different feel to it as U.S.-backed Kurds and Arabs in the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) tightened their siege . The fighting seemed slower and more measured , step by step along abandoned streets where journalists were given access . In the weeks before Raqqa s fall in October , young female SDF fighters faced off against hardened militants and suffered losses . But that did not curb their enthusiasm and some said they would eventually like to join Kurdish PKK militants in Turkey and help advance their 33-year-old insurgency there . The victors in Iraq and Syria now face new challenges as they rebuild cities shattered by the showdown with IS . After IS s defeat in Raqqa , Raqqa residents formed a council to run the city but they had no budget when it was first set up , just residents streaming into their tin , run-down headquarters demanding everything from instant jobs to getting their damaged farmland back . Syrian Kurdish fighters were inspired by the ideas of Abdullah Ocalan , head of the PKK militants who has been imprisoned in Turkey for almost 20 years . Turkey views the political rise of Syria s Kurds as a threat to its national security and is fiercely opposed to the idea of Kurdish autonomy on its doorstep . The Kurdish groups who led the fight against Islamic State in its former capital Raqqa must now navigate a complex peace to avoid ethnic tension with the city s Arab majority and to secure critical U.S. aid . So , life for Raqqa s victors will remain fraught with risk .',\n",
       " 'Republicans have been vowing to honor the memory of recently-deceased racist hatemonger , Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , by blocking any and all nominees Obama might put forward to replace him , no matter who they are . While Scalia himself would disagree with the intrusion of politics into the judicial appointment process , Ted Cruz promises to filibuster any nominee and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will use every tool at his disposal to block nominations until after the election , when they hope a Republican is in office ( good luck with that , guys ) .While Republicans often invoke Ronald Reagan as they struggle to excuse most of their actions , they are similarly ignoring the former President s opinion on the matter . In 1988 , Saint Ronnie made it clear while urging the Senate to confirm Anthony M. Kennedy that he doesn t quite agree with childishly blocking nominations , either : In the year ahead , we re not going to be on the defensive , shoring up problems and answering our critics . We are moving forward , and I have no doubt that when we look back 1988 will be a year of great accomplishment toward our goals . This is the year when Judge Anthony Kennedy will be confirmed and the Supreme Court will again be brought up to full strength . The Federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football . I would hope , and the American people should expect , not only for Judge Kennedy s confirmation but for the Senate to get to work and act on 27 other judicial nominations that have been left in limbo for quite awhile now.That s right Republicans are so desperate to deny Obama a judicial nomination that they are willing to ignore tradition , the wishes of the person they are supposedly honoring in this destructive and asinine action , and even the words of their messiah.Watch the remarks from Saint Ronnie s January 25 , 1985 State of the Union Address below : Watch Ronald Reagan urge the Senate to confirm Justice Kennedy during an election year .

       " 'A man affiliated with the illegal occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in the Oregon standoff with police was out and about driving around town in his white 2003 Ford van , when he ended up crashing his vehicle into a barb-wire fence , completely flipping the car over in the process.We re not sure if he was out looking for snacks , but The Oregon State Police posted a picture of the crash on their Twitter page on Sunday . Now , get this not only was he being an unsafe driver on icy roads ( propelling the car more than 150 ft. away from the road ) , but he was also driving without a license ! Fortunately , he wasn t injured ( we wouldn t wish that on anyone ) but safety issues aside , all the police did was cite him for operating a motor vehicle without a license . That s it . He wasn t arrested , as many would presume.State Police Spokesman Bill Fugate wouldn t provide more details about the incident , other than to say : Oregon only cites for No Operator s License , we do not arrest . Pic via Twitter.It looks like the police aren t too concerned with Mr. Burke s activities of occupying federal property . Perhaps one reason is that he wasn t driving a federal van from the property ; it appears to be his own.Just a few days ago , another militant by the name of Kenneth Medenback left the compound for a snack run . State police decided to arrest him for theft of two government vehicles , not the occupation itself . And , that was the very first arrest of the occupation so far . At this rate it s going to take forever to arrest all these guys . So , while law enforcement doesn t appear to be taking an active stance of ending the illegal protest itself , they are still somewhat concerned with upholding some of the laws on the books . That s some good news , at least.Featured image via Twitter .',\n",

       " 'BUDAPEST - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a death sentence for democracy . Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival , support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year . Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative , anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls , with Jobbik its nearest rival . Jobbik , once on the far right , has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban , depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang . Orban , rejecting the charges , says his financial standing is an open book . Last week the state audit office ( ASZ ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices , breaching rules on political funding , then it slapped a 663 million forint ( $ 2.5 million ) penalty on the party . The protesters , waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite , gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party . What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation . It is not an official penalty . This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it . But in reality , it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy , Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd . A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks . ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker , whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban . The audit office denies that . On Friday , ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings , saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe . The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe . This case has nothing to do with the election campaign , Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday . For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik , whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right , said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis . Gyorgy Illes , a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally , said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions . This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy . It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear . Democracy , the rule of law , equality , you name it , he said .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank , breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies . Powell , 64 , a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama , emerged as Trump ’ s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included Yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift . In an announcement at the White House , Trump described the soft-spoken Powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on Yellen ’ s achievements in steering the U.S. economy after the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis . “ If we are to sustain all this progress , our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight , ” Trump said as Powell looked on . “ We need strong and steady leadership at the U.S. Federal Reserve ... He will provide exactly that. ” Powell has worked alongside Yellen for the past five years , backing her direction on monetary policy and , in recent years , sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates . Yellen ’ s four-year term as Fed chief ends in early February 2018 . She will be the first U.S. central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since 1979 . Trump on Thursday lauded Yellen ’ s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term . The Republican president said he was impressed by Powell ’ s experience in the private-sector and “ real-world perspective ” to government . “ He understands what it takes for our economy to grow , ” Trump said . Powell , who in the last 25 years has done a prototypical Washington circuit of government , private , and think tank jobs , pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the Fed has on average Americans . He will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low . “ Monetary policy decisions matter for American families and communities . I strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence , ” Powell said in brief remarks after Trump ’ s announcement . His nomination now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation . “ I ’ m encouraged by President Trump ’ s choice , ” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that pledged “ timely ” consideration of the nomination . There was little apparent market reaction to Powell ’ s nomination , which had been expected . Investors were largely focused on the release of details of a Republican plan to broadly change the U.S. tax code . By setting benchmark short-term interest rates , the Fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy . Since the crisis , the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector , while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality . Yellen , a Fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system , said in a written statement that she would work with Powell “ to ensure a smooth transition. ” Trump ’ s decision , after a broad and very public search , offers what analysts said was a classic compromise , allowing him to select his own Fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the Yellen-run central bank . “ The kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting Powell , ( Trump ) has all but selected Yellen , ” said Sarah Binder , a political science professor at George Washington University and author of a recent book on Fed politics . “ There is not really much daylight , if any. ” In June , Powell laid out both a defense of the Fed ’ s gradualist path and a critique of those , including some of his competitors for the Fed job , who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems . Trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low , a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list , particularly Stanford University economist John Taylor and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh . Top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn also was a contender . Powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by Yellen on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee , and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and U.S. stock markets near record highs . The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month . But Powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis , also important to Trump . Powell can now pursue that end along with Trump appointee Randal Quarles , the Fed ’ s new vice chair for supervision . Though he will be the first Fed chief since the late 1970s without an advanced degree in economics , Powell brings market insights , Fed board experience and Republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition . Under President George H.W . Bush , Powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the Treasury . From 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the Carlyle Group , a private equity firm , and focused on public debt dynamics while at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank . Yellen is entitled to remain as a Fed governor until 2024 , though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Television talk show host Jimmy Kimmel called out a Republican U.S. senator pushing the party ’ s latest healthcare overhaul plan , saying the lawmaker had “ lied right to my face ” about efforts to scrap Obamacare by backing a measure that would strip coverage from many Americans . Kimmel , who became part of the debate on U.S. healthcare legislation in May after emotionally discussing his newborn son ’ s emergency heart surgery , took aim at Senator Bill Cassidy on his show on Tuesday night . Along with fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham , Cassidy authored a bill that now has White House support to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act passed under former Democratic President Barack Obama . Kimmel has called for healthcare that will ensure treatment for children who do not come from wealthy families , like his . Cassidy appeared on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live ! ” in May and said he supported access to preventative care regardless of income . Cassidy had said any healthcare bill must pass what he called “ the Jimmy Kimmel test ” of providing affordable care for such children and include preventative care for every American . “ This guy Bill Cassidy just lied right to my face , ” Kimmel said on Tuesday . “ This new bill actually does pass the Jimmy Kimmel test but a different Jimmy Kimmel test . With this one , your child with a pre-existing condition will get the care he needs - if , and only if , his father is Jimmy Kimmel . Otherwise , you might be screwed. ” Cassidy responded to Kimmel ’ s comments with a statement defending his bill as “ must-pass ” legislation to help cover people and noting Republicans faced a Sept. 30 deadline . The Graham-Cassidy plan would allow states to opt out of some consumer protections and waive regulations requiring insurers to include certain benefits , as well as end the expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled . It remains unclear whether Republicans have enough support to pass the bill , which also would replace Obamacare with a system giving states block grants to fund their own healthcare programs . Democrats have been united in opposing Republican efforts to make good on their years-long pledge to dismantle current law , a promise that also was central to U.S. Republican President Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign . A bipartisan group of governors , major health industry groups and consumer advocates also opposed the latest bill . Kimmel and others urged Congress to instead stabilize current insurance markets with a package spearheaded by the Senate health committee ’ s Republican chairman and ranking Democrat . “ Right now , there ’ s a bipartisan group of senators working to improve the healthcare system we have , ” Kimmel said on his show . “ Go pitch in and be a part of that ... And if not ? Stop using my name . ”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Several intriguing scenarios could unfold after Tuesday ’ s U.S. election to break the deadlock over filling a Supreme Court vacancy that has provoked a bitter nine-month standoff between President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans . Obama nominated U.S. appeals court judge Merrick Garland on March 16 to replace long-serving conservative justice Antonin Scalia , who died on Feb. 13 . The Republican-led Senate , in a move with little precedent , has refused to consider the nomination , saying the winner of the presidential election should make the pick . If Republican Donald Trump wins , Garland ’ s nomination would be dead . Trump has already put forth a list of conservative jurists as potential nominees . If Obama ’ s fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton wins , there are ways Garland could secure Senate confirmation to the lifetime post before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20 . Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant that Obama ’ s successor should select Scalia ’ s replacement and that he will not consider Garland ’ s nomination during a post-election “ lame duck ” session . But McConnell could come under pressure by some Senate Republicans to allow confirmation hearings and a vote on Garland , who has a reputation in Washington as a moderate , out of fear Clinton could instead choose a more liberal nominee . The Senate ’ s inaction on Garland has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election . After many years of leaning conservative , a new Democratic appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades . Scalia ’ s death left the court split with four liberals and four conservatives . Conservative activists dismiss the notion Garland is a moderate , saying he would vote with the four liberal justices on major , ideologically divisive issues . “ Garland is a liberal , not a centrist , ” said Carrie Severino , a lawyer with the Judicial Crisis Network . Liberal activists like Caroline Fredrickson , president of the American Constitution Society , said Republicans should move forward on Garland . “ He ’ s got every qualification you could ask for . He ’ s exactly the type of judge they claimed they wanted , ” Fredrickson said . If Democrats win control of the Senate in Tuesday ’ s election , the new congressional session would begin on Jan. 3 , and they could decide to move forward immediately on Garland ’ s nomination before Obama ’ s term ends . Clinton would play a major role by deciding whether or not she wanted to stick with Garland , who was named to his current job by her husband Bill Clinton in 1997 , or choose her own nominee . “ Chief Judge Garland is the most experienced nominee to the Supreme Court in our nation ’ s history , ” White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said . It is time for Republicans to “ stop putting politics over the best interest of the country and do their job by giving the president ’ s nominee to the Supreme Court a hearing and a vote , ” she added . Clinton has said Garland should be confirmed this year but has not committed to re-nominating him if she wins . Some Republicans have floated the idea of staunch opposition to any Clinton nominee , raising the possibility of the seat remaining vacant long-term . McConnell has said no Obama nominee will be confirmed this year . There are no signs so far of Republican leaders backing off that position . Garland , 63 , and other members of the Washington legal community joined the eight current justices inside the Supreme Court ’ s ornate courtroom on Friday at an memorial event honoring Scalia , four days before the election that will help decide his fate . There has been little controversy over Garland ’ s suitability to sit on the Supreme Court as there has been with some past nominees . He is widely respected in the legal community and has won praise from Democrats and Republicans .',\n",

The 58-year-old woman ordered the murder - which was never carried out - in March , transferring 4.1 bitcoin , then worth around $ 4,000 , to the hitman s virtual wallet , the court found . Bitcoin can be transferred electronically between users without an intermediary such as a bank , making it potentially attractive for buying illegal goods or services .

       " 'VIENNA - Young conservative star Sebastian Kurz is on track to become Austria s next leader , projections of Sunday s parliamentary election result showed , but his party is well short of a majority and could seek an alliance with the far right . Kurz , who is just 31 , campaigned on an anti-immigration platform so strict that the far-right Freedom Party ( FPO ) accused him of plagiarism . That appears to have succeeded in drawing some voters away from the FPO two years after Austria was swept up in Europe s migration crisis , which boosted the FPO in polls . Kurz s People s Party ( OVP ) is in the lead on 30.5 percent , with its current coalition partner , the Social Democrats , on 26.2 percent , just behind the FPO on 26.8 percent , a projection by pollster SORA said shortly after polls closed , based on an early count of 49 percent of non-postal ballots . The projection had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points . It will be refreshed and become more precise as more ballots are counted throughout the evening . Another projection by pollster ARGE Wahlen also showed the OVP in the lead . Kurz , named party leader only in May , has been careful to keep his coalition options open , but he called an end to the current alliance with the Social Democrats and pledged to shake up Austrian politics , which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between those two parties . While that would suggest he will turn to the anti-Islam FPO , he has also said there could be leadership changes within the losing parties , a possible hint at being willing to work with the Social Democrats if Chancellor Christian Kern were ousted as leader by Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil . The Social Democrats ( SPO ) have also opened the door to forming coalitions with the FPO , meaning the far-right party is placed to be kingmaker and play the two parties off each other during coalition talks . It is highly unlikely , however , that the Social Democrats would ally with the FPO if the SPO came third .',\n",
       " 'A Birmingham , Alabama ABC affiliate sought out voters in Columbiana , AL to gauge their reactions to the Washington Post report that alleged Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore engaged in inappropriate conduct with four teenage girls more than 34 years ago.None of the respondents according to Walsh told her they believed the Post s reporting . It s hard to believe the events that transpired yesterday , Gordon Fluker of nearby Wilsonville , AL said to Walsh about the Washington Post report.Moore continues to lead his Democrat opponent by double digits Voters are not buying the accusers story The latest problem with the story is the mother of the accuser s story . She just made a huge mistake in her recounting of what happened over 34 years ago The character assassination of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore continues with different RINO Republicans coming out to say Moore should step down as a candidate for US Senate . The problem is that the press and the anti-Moore politicians have crucified Moore We thought you were innocent until proven guilty ! Another key fact : The claim is a 40 year old claim brought to light by a woman who has ties to the DNC So many things about this claim just don t pass the smell test . Breitbart News has yet another item that doesn t help the accuser s case : MOTHER MAKES BIG MISTAKE : The mother of Leigh Corfman , who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 , has contradicted a key detail of Corfman s story . Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday , Corfman s mother , Nancy Wells , 71 , says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman purportedly on Confman s bedroom phone to arrange at least one encounter.Moore strongly denies Corfman s claims.The Washington Post , which first published its newsmaking , on-the-record interview with Corfman last week , cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14 . She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.Citing Corfman , the Post reported : After her mother went into the courtroom , Corfman says , Moore asked her where she went to school , what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime . She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after . She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom , and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street , around the corner from her house.Soon after , Corfman said , he called again , and picked her up again at the same spot.Later on , Corfman described a third phone call : She says that after their last encounter , Moore called again , but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him . She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore , she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was her phone in her bedroom on at least one of those occasions . The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.Wells , Corfman s mother , was asked by Breitbart News : Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something ? No , she replied matter-of-factly . But the phone in the house could get through to her easily . HOW COULD HE BE GUILTY ? The Post story relies heavily on Corfman s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.The newspaper reported that Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post . The Post story uses the word remembers 10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.Here are those 10 times:1 : The Post cited Corfman thusly : I wanted it over with I wanted out , she remembers thinking . This detail related to Corfman s claim that Moore drove her to his house , removed his own clothes besides his underwear , took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.2 : During the initial alleged encounter , when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman s mother went into the courtroom , the Post reported , She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after . 3 : I remember the further I got from my house , the more nervous I got , Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.5 7 : The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph : She remembers an unpaved driveway . She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next , and that at some point she told him she was 14 . She says they sat and talked . She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty , put his arm around her and kissed her , and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home , which she says he did.8 Referring to the alleged sexual encounter , the Post reported : She remembers that Moore kissed her , that he took off her pants and shirt , and that he touched her through her bra and underpants . She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.9 In that same encounter , the Post relates : She remembers thinking , I don t want to do this and I need to get out of here . She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home , and that he did.Meanwhile , Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post s story . It s truthful and it was researched very well , she said.Asked if she could remember Moore , then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney , allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1971 while Wells went into a courtroom , Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.Wells told this reporter : We were sitting in the hall . He came up and started talking to us . We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court . He said , you know , What are you doing . You know , we told him . He is Roy Moore . And he said , You don t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering . And I said , No . He said , I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in . And so that is the way it started . Probably if it were in today s times that never would have happened , Wells added . He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse . Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post , including three divorces , bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.The Post related : She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking , drugs , boyfriends , and a suicide attempt when she was 16.As the years went on , Corfman says , she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life . She has had three divorces and financial problems . While living in Arizona , she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt . They filed for bankruptcy protection three times , once in 1991 with $ 139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors , according to court records.Moore strongly denied Corfman s claims . These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign , Moore said in immediate response to the Post s story.Moore s campaign said in a statement , This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation . The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife , Kayla , for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren . It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.The statement said : The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests , twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice . He has been a three-time candidate for local office , and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking , judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage . After over 40 years of public service , if any of these allegations were true , they surely would have been made public long before now , the statement continued.On Saturday , Moore further addressed the allegations : Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about , Moore said at a local campaign event . Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate , the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law , on my wife , and on me . For weeks , we read about my salary which they distorted , about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got . But we endured that . Later , they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race , he continued . Just two days ago , the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate . These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago . But more than being completely false and untrue , they are very hurtful to me personally . I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present , I have not provided alcoholic beverages beer or anything else to a minor . I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone , he declared . These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12 . Why now ? For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media . I have had investigations by the attorney general , I ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion , I ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary , I ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research they do investigations , as you can see in every one I ve ever run and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage , he continued . I ve been investigated more than any other person in this country . That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable .',\n",

As it seems , Muslims are possibly attempting to carry out an attack by using airplanes again.The investigation by The National Transportation Safety Board also indicates the crash is the result of an intentional act , which means the likelihood this involves an act of terrorism . FBI and police have also raided the pilot s apartment and are questioning three of the associates of Feras M. Freitekh , the pilot . The Jordanian students were also studying to become pilots.Freitekh who was killed on impact is a 28-year-old Jordanian national from a Palestinian background who was studying to become a pilot died after crashing a small plane Tuesday afternoon in Connecticut , and the instructor pilot who survived the crash said it was intentional . Family and friends of Freitekh are already writing about him on Facebook with oodles of praises from good man hero to Allah be with him in Arabic . Click and check it out for yourself . Rafeek Zabian comments Our old friend , Feras Freitekh , is with Allah , after he fulfilled his dream to fly , he died as a pilot , yes , and he accomplished his dream , may Allah be with you .Here are pictures from the Facebook page of in what appears to be Mecca . The pictures appear to be very recent , as they are dated June 3 , 2016 . People see him kissing the tip of the propeller and they do not think . The kiss is a kiss for the tip of his missile he is using . He and the Muslims and relatives commenting know why he came to the U.S . The argument with the co-pilot that he does not want to fly anymore is an excuse to land early because his intention is likely to swerve at the US defense contractor facility . It would take hours to include all the other praises from folks who would seem normal to the naked eye , yet they harbor ill for the United States.What is alarming about this crash is that the crash occurred near Pratt & Whitney , a defense contractor that makes jet engines for the military . Pratt & Whitney is a major defense contractor which manufactures military and commercial jet engines . East Hartford Police Chief called the company s plant critical infrastructure , the Hartford Courant reports . Police said the FBI was contacted because of the proximity to Pratt & Whitney.A high-ranking law enforcement source told the Hartford Courant there was an argument between the student pilot and the instructor prior to the crash . Terrorism is a criminal act , East Hartford Police spokesman Lieutenant Joshua Litwin said at a press conference . There is a lot of criminal investigators on scene . Nothing has been ruled out . The surviving flight instructor , identified by the Courant as Arian Prevalla , was able to get out of the plane after the crash and is expected to survive . Freitekh came to the United States from Jordan in 2012 on a temporary M-1 visa for flight school . The FBI and local police raided an apartment on Annawan Street as part of the investigation , WVIT-TV reports . Neighbors told WTIC-TV that four men lived together in the apartment targeted by police . Sources told the Hartford Courant the three other men who lived there were also foreign nationals studying to become pilots . And don t be fooled , the pilot , Feras M. Freitekh also has another Facebook as Rafael Majdi Freitekh and he is gay with all the rainbow flags . He was not a peaceful Muslim and neither was he a peaceful gay after all , as society tries to arm-twist us to believe about Muslims and gays . He stops writing anything on his timeline for a year is perhaps the man decided to go dark becoming a lone-wolf.The instructor pilot who survived the crash was hospitalized with serious burns , CBS News reports . He was identified as Adrian Prevalla by the Hartford Courant . Officials say he is cooperating with the investigation . He runs the Hartford Jet Center , according to his Linkedin profile . The flight school is based at Hartford-Brainard Airport , where the plane took off from on Tuesday.Via : Shoebat',\n",

There needs to be more police here , she said , showing a wound to her right ankle , where police say she was grazed.The woman was one of four people struck by gunfire in the 1:15 p.m. ambush that left Brown , a Burke High junior , dead . Her name is being withheld by the Herald because she is a witness to the murder.She explained she was in an alley by a pizza shop when the shooting broke out . The teen , who was sitting down eating a hamburger , got up and pushed her to the side by a car , she claimed.Last night hundreds of people , including at least a dozen family members , crowded in front of the market on Washington Street less than a block from the school where Brown fell.Some men turned and walked away in tears while several women dabbed their eyes with tissues from a box that was being passed around . Brown s mother , Wanda Graddy , supported by several relatives , walked toward a memorial for her son , where she cried , My boy , my boy . The Rev . William Dickerson of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church spoke first and called for the killer to step forward and for witnesses to name him . We pray that justice will come in the midst of this terrible reality , Dickerson said.Family members said they hope that whoever pulled the trigger will surrender . Stop being cowards , said Raekwon s older brother , John Brown . Stand up like a man . Take your consequences . Beside him was the slain teen s godmother , Jacqueline Cane . I just want you to know , whoever did it , turn yourself in , she said . You re not going to sleep until you turn yourself in . That was a good guy here . This was my God-baby . Seventeen years old , you took his life . Turn yourself in or you will never rest . Mourners said another prayer and then hugged as they departed.Burke school staff also took time out from the day to recall Brown as a selfless teen . Raekwon was probably one of the most loving and caring students I have ever had in the Sophomore Academy , said Cheryl Windle , leader for the academy . He actually had this warmth about him that I really believe captures his true essence . He will truly be missed by all of us here at the Burke community . Lindsa McIntyre , headmaster of Burke , said students and staff will miss Brown dearly . He came to us as a vibrant , struggling , middle school student , looking for fun and full of vim and vigor . But as he grew in his high school career , he became a metamorphosis for what a real Burke student looks like . Via : Boston Herald',\n",
       " 'ANKARA - Leading Turkish and U.S. businesses urged the governments of Turkey and the United States on Tuesday to resolve a series of diplomatic rows that have prompted both countries to cut back on issuing visas to each other s citizens . Turkey has fumed over what it sees as U.S. reluctance to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen , accused by Ankara of orchestrating an abortive military coup last year , and over U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia , seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . Gulen denies any connection with the coup bid . The Turkish-U.S. Business Council ( TAIK ) called on the U.S. and Turkish governments to engage in talks to resolve the rows and prevent harm to both of their economies and citizens . We call on the governments of Turkey and America to enter into discussions to reach a meaningful resolution to the existing differences so that neither of our peoples or economies suffer , TAIK said in a statement . Relations sank to a new low with the arrest of a second U.S. consular worker earlier this month over alleged links to last year s coup attempt . The statement by TAIK , a council comprised of leading Turkish and U.S. corporations such as Ford , Microsoft , and Turkish Airlines , was the latest in a series of appeals to the NATO allies to settle their differences . But President Tayyip Erdogan has not retreated from the row , castigating Washington over democracy issues in comments that may further dim hopes of a resolution .',\n",
       " 'In new leaked audio that will make your skin crawl , Donald Trump s incredible misogyny is clearly displayed.When the Republican nominee bought the Miss USA contest he instituted a rule he calls the Trump rule in which he and his staff line all of the contestants up so that he can ogle them up close and only pick the most beautiful women to compete in the pageant.First , Trump lines up the women and starts dividing them based on their looks . At one point in the audio Trump remarks that women in West Virginia don t know what cellulite is , a backhanded comment meant to fat-shame women who don t meet his personal standards.He also asked contestants to choose contestants they think are pretty enough to compete for the Miss USA title , essentially allowing certain contestants to judge the others . Thus , the women were divided into groups based on which women made Trump horny.Trump went on to complain to the women about how the judges were supposedly judging the contest wrong and that the most beautiful women were left backstage instead of being picked to win.While Trump is obsessed with the women s looks , the contest has not been just about who is the prettiest . Personality is also judged.But Trump thinks only looks matter , so he and his team inspected the women and jotted down notes on a pad of paper about each one . So if a woman had a mole that Trump didn t like , it was more than likely marked down and used against her in the judging.Here s the audio via The Daily Beast : This is about as creepy as it gets , and as Raw Story points out , confirms what former Miss USA 2009 runner-up Carrie Prejean wrote in her book about Trump . Prejean described the experience of Trump looking over the girls as humiliating . We were told to put on our opening number outfits they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits and line up for him on stage , she wrote . Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any general ever inspected a platoon . He would stop in front of a girl , look her up and down , and say , Hmmm . Then he would go on and do the same thing to the next girl . He took notes in a little pad as he went along . Many of the girls found this exercise humiliating . Some of the girls were sobbing backstage after he left , devastated to have failed even before the competition really began to impress The Donald . Donald Trump is a creep who doesn t deserve a single vote from any woman in America . As Bill Maher noted during his show on Friday , the only concrete position Trump has taken throughout his campaign is no fat chicks . It s a cruel and creepy policy Trump has held his entire life and he should be punished for it in November . He and the Republican Party need to learn that women come in all shapes and size and that women are sick of the bullshit way they are treated by them.Featured Image : Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images',\n",

Evil Dead actor Bruce Campbell was the one to correct them in a brilliant way that makes them look truly stupid and exposes them for the frauds that they are.The particular incident Campbell gracefully debunked was at a Trump event in San Jose , California , where protesters expressed hostility at the presumptive nominee s supporters . After things took a turn for the worse , pro-Trump Twitter account Conservative Nation tried to leverage the event to get even more sympathy for Trumpers by tweeting a photo of a bloodied woman and saying that her wounds were caused by demonstrators . Here s that tweet : TwitterFortunately Campbell saw the tweet , and didn t hesitate to fact-check the admins of Conservative Nation in front of his 400K+ Twitter followers . Campbell revealed that the woman in the photograph was not a bloodied Trump supporter at all she was actually an actress for comedy-horror series Ash VS .

       " \"It s Thursday , July 20th . As of today , Donald Trump has been president for 6 months . The media coverage of the president is overwhelmingly negative : the press remains contemptuous , and they re pushing to get him out before he completes his first term.Investors might think differently . The great success of the Trump presidency thus far , is not what he s done , but what he promises to do , namely , get the economy going again . Evidently , investors believe he might yet get it done.Look at this : since his election win , the Trump rally has added $ 4.1 trillion to the nation s wealth . Anyone with a 401k , an IRA , college savings , retirement savings , mutual funds . Anyone with a dime in the market has taken a piece of that $ 4 trillion . Fox NewsWhile President Trump has been incredibly busy working with American businesses and cutting trade deals with foreign leaders to benefit American businesses and workers , the media intentionally ignores his accomplishments , and focuses instead , on a manufactured Russian-collusion story . Compare President Trump s first successful 6 months in office to those of media darling Barack Obama : From siding with terrorists hell-bent on destroying Israel , to ensuring federal funds could be used for abortion , to adding 17,000 more troops to a war Obama promised he would end , the first 2 months of Obama s presidency were about as anti-American as our nation has ever seen . Wasn t anyone in the media just a tad bit curious about Barack Obama s first act as our newly sworn in president , that placed a temporary halt on the trials for terrorists at Guantanamo Bay ? 20 January 2009 Obama is sworn in as the 44th president of the US Hours after taking office , Obama requests a temporary halt to Guant namo Bay trials.21 January Hillary Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state.22 January The president brings in executive orders aimed at reforming the US s detention policy . He orders the closure of black sites , where CIA and European security services have interrogated terrorist suspects . He also orders interrogations of detainees across the entire US intelligence community to adhere to the US Army Field Manual and orders the closure of the Guant namo Bay prison within 12 months.23 January- Obama orders the end of the Mexico City Rule which had banned federal funding of NGOs that performed abortions or offered abortion counselling . It is strongly criticised by the Vatican.26 January Obama outlines his energy policy , saying America must become more self-sufficient and calling for an energy economy to create jobs . He said the US should not be a hostage to dwindling resources , hostile regimes , and a warming planet .27 January In his first TV interview , to the al-Arabiya network , Obama spoke of improved relations with the Middle East . On Israel , he reiterated US support but said : I do believe the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people . And that instead , it s time to return to the negotiating table . 29 January Obama signs his first bill into law , the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act . The law ends a 2007 Supreme Court decision that said workers had only 180 days to file a pay discrimination lawsuit.5 February The last terror trial at Guant namo Bay is halted after the judge dropped charges against a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000.17 February In Denver , Colorado , Obama signs into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , aimed at rescuing the economy.WSJ The $ 830 billion spending blowout was sold by the White House as a way to keep unemployment from rising above 8 % . But the stimulus would fail on its own terms . 2009 marked the first of four straight years when unemployment averaged more than 8 % . And of course the unemployment rate would have been even worse in those years and still today if so many people had not quit the labor force , driving labor-participation rates to 1970s levels . Given that Governments are generally the worst allocators of capital it should come as no real surprise that the money was squandered on non-productive investments . $ 783,000 was spent on a study of why young people consume malt liquor and marijuana . $ 92,000 went to the Army Corps of Engineers for costumes for mascots like Bobber the Water Safety Dog . $ 219,000 funded a study of college hookups .

Obama later denies the offer was made , though admits he sent the letter.By the third month of Donald Trump s presidency , the media was in full-frenzy mode over manufactured ties to President Trump and alleged hacking into our elections by the Russians . Every day , a new unnamed source was revealed an unverified fact about how Donald Trump or his administration was allegedly tied to Russian interference in our elections that the press believed ultimately led to Hillary Clinton s loss . In his third anti-American month as president , the most the media could dig up on Barack Obama , was that his hair was turning grey . 5 March Newspapers and blogs in the US are abuzz over the possibility that Obama s hair is already turning grey.9 March The president removes restrictions on funding for stem cell research and a memorandum to protect science from political interference , reversing the Bush administration s strict policy.Barack Obama was only the President of the United States for 3 months ( exactly ) when he began to cozy up to Iran .

       " 'MADRID - Shortly after the Catalan government defied Madrid and held a referendum on independence , Jaume Vives held his own vote on whether to separate his central Barcelona balcony from this Catalonia of madmen . Using a megaphone , the 25-year-old journalist declared the nine votes cast by his assembled friends and family were really 2.4 million - a slightly inaccurate reference to the 2.3 million who voted for a break with Spain . Then he suspended the decision just as Catalan president Carles Puigdemont had done with his Oct. 10 decision to pursue independence in the Catalan parliament . A video of the stunt has been watched 890,000 times on YouTube as people on both sides of the independence divide turn to satire to break the tension of a real-life drama that is both dividing and maddening the nation . The drama s two main actors - Puigdemont and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy - are the butt of most jibes . The anti-independence camp has aimed its jokes at Puigdemont and what they see as his reluctance to be decisive and his flip-flop statements on the independence question . In recent weeks , he has declared independence then suspended his declaration , accepted an invitation to address the Senate then declined it , and called for an independence vote in Catalan parliament and then deferred it . One bar in Barcelona recently put up a sign that declared free beer for all - but then , tongue-in-cheek , said the measure was immediately suspended pending talks with the beer company . One mock TV game show presented a puzzled Puigdemont considering his answer to the final question of an episode of Who wants to be a millionaire ? What is Catalonia right now ? , the question read on the screen , with the four possible answers listed as : A - a region ? B - Neverland ? C - a Republic ? , or D - a circus ? On the other side , satirists have homed in on Prime Minister Rajoy and his insistence that Puigdemont renounce independence as a condition of negotiations . In one online parody , Rajoy is shown with U.S. President Donald Trump s hair and a caption saying : I will build a wall , - and Catalonia will pay for it . At a recent pro-independence demonstration in Barcelona he appeared on a poster kissing Spanish dictator Francisco Franco - historically a hate figure in Catalonia - on the lips amid a burst of pink heart shapes . Another , shared hundreds of thousands of times on Whatsapp , shows Rajoy embracing Puigdemont and saying , He stays , in a parody of a famous tweet from FC Barcelona defender Gerard Pique announcing that Brazilian star Neymar would not leave the club . Neymar signed for Paris Saint Germain days later . The satire highlights the fatigue that both sides feel . Barcelona has buzzed for the past two months with repeated , large-scale protests , mostly for independence but also including one rally of more than 300,000 against secession . Humor has become a means of escape from the seemingly endless tension . From his balcony in the upmarket residential neighborhood of Sarria-Sant Gervasi , Vives described his lone anti-independence as a Smiling Counter-Revolution . We are reducing to absurdity the absurd reality we are living , and the lies they tell us , Vives said . Doing this reduces the tension in the atmosphere . Jokes don t feed hatred .',\n",

       " 'As you are probably aware , Donald Trump decided to pop into Detroit for an ill-advised attempt to form a false , vote-getting connection with the African-American community . Currently , the Donald is doing worse with minorities than even Mitt Romney did during his presidential run against Barack Obama , and his previous outreach efforts telling African-Americans they are poor , uneducated , and have nothing to offer the world as well as his tight connections with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups are not doing him any favors.After Trump s embarrassing , scripted interview with a Detroit pastor was leaked , Trump knew he had to step it up . So he went out into the community to visit the neighborhood of his former rival-turned-paid-servant Ben Carson ( yes , the one in which he tried to stab someone only to be thwarted by a belt buckle ) . CNN caught up with Carson after Trump left and asked him what was apparently a difficult question . We just saw Mr. Trump here and I asked him how did it go and he said Great . He said he learned a lot of things . What do you think he took away from today ? CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked.That s right he asked Carson if Trump learned something from spending a few minutes around black people . This led Carson to have a Rubio moment , but with luggage rather than a water bottle . Carson s face twisted into a look of concern , then terror : Then he walked away , successfully avoiding the question.How did Donald Trump do during his visit ? Not only was the church he visited virtually empty , but one woman who lives in Carson s childhood home told the Detroit Free Press that Trump s visit was clearly a photo-op . Her takeaway from his obvious and meaningless attempt to pander to the African-American community while offering nothing substantive is that people should vote Democratic .

       " 'Donald Trump has been crucified by the leftist mainstream media , GOP RINO s and Democrat leaders non-stop for his brash outspoken ways . But after 54 years of voting for Democrats , and getting absolutely nothing but a permanent ticket to their inner city plantation , his tough talk is starting to resonate with minorities who want to make a better life for themselves . They want to see a President who truly cares about seeing them succeed and isn t just in this race as the next step in his political career This is not going to set well with pandering Hillary Quanell X , leader of the New Black Panther Party in Houston , Texas , said this week on a local news program that black Americans should truly examine Donald Trump s outreach to the black community and reexamine the relationship that black voters have with the Democratic Party.America s in trouble . And I want to say to black and white people , only a fool fights in a burning house . This house is on fire.Read the transcript of Quanell X s remarks : Donald Trump last week went to Milwaukee because of the rioting behind the police shooting of a young African-American male by a black officer and the city was being burned down in certain parts of the black community by protesters so Donald Trump decided to go to Milwaukee and speak about the conditions of America and why he felt black people should vote for him . He even went on to lay out reasons why he felt we should.Let me say this to the brothers and sisters who listened and watched that speech . We may not like the vessel that said what he said , but I ask us to truly examine what he said , because it is a fact that for 54 years , we have been voting for the Democratic party like no other race in America . And they have not given us the same loyalty and love that we have given them . We as black people have to reexamine the relationship where we are being pimped like prostitutes , and they re the big pimps pimping us politically , promising us everything and we get nothing in return.We got ta step back now as black people and say , we ve got ta look at all the parties and vote our best interests.He spoke directly to black people . And I want to say and encourage the brothers and sisters . Barack Obama , our president , served two terms . The first black president ever . But did our condition get better ? Did financially , politically , academically , with education in our community , did things get better ? Are our young people working more than what is was before he came into office ? The condition got worse . So now we as black people have to do and remember what the honorable Elijah Mohammed said . No politician can save the black community ; we ve got ta do it ourselves.Via : Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday said it delivered documents to congressional committees responding to their request for information that could shed light on President Donald Trump ’ s claims that former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. agencies to spy on him . The information was sent to the House and Senate intelligence and judiciary committees , said Sarah Isgur Flores , a Justice Department spokeswoman . The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Republican Devin Nunes , said in a statement late on Friday that the Justice Department had “ fully complied ” with the panel ’ s request . A government source , who requested anonymity when discussing sensitive information , said an initial examination of the material turned over by the Justice Department indicates that it contains no evidence to confirm Trump ’ s claims that the Obama administration had wiretapped him or the Trump Tower in New York . The House Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on Monday on allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election . Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers will testify and are expected to field questions on Trump ’ s wiretap claim . Leaders of both the House and Senate intelligence committees , including from Trump ’ s Republican Party , have said they have found no evidence to substantiate Trump ’ s claims that Obama ordered U.S. agencies to spy on Trump or his entourage . The White House has publicly offered no proof of the allegation . On Monday , the House panel sent the Justice Department a letter asking for copies of any court orders related to Trump or his associates which might have been issued last year under an electronic surveillance law or a wide-ranging anti-crime statute .',\n",
       " 'Rudy Giuliani s health insurance won t cover this burn.The former New York City mayor who now forgets about 9/11 has been repeatedly peddling conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton s health on behalf of Donald Trump , insisting that she is too sick to be president and the only proof he offers is to tell people to go on the Internet and do a search on Google.During The Late Show on Tuesday night , Stephen Colbert took Giuliani to the woodshed for spreading unsubstantiated bullshit . Yes , Rudy Giuliani says just diagnose Hillary on the Internet , Colbert said . Because if it s on the internet you know it s true . For instance , I put my symptoms into WebMD and found out I have menopause . Colbert then did exactly what Giuliani told everyone to do and found hilarious results.As it turns out , the first thing Colbert found was a video of Giuliani saying that Hillary is sick . And that led to Colbert hilariously diagnosing Giuliani . So , let me get this straight , let me explain this to you . Here s what s happening : Giuliani says she s not healthy and then look it up on the Internet . And when you look it up on the Internet it says Giuliani says she s not healthy and to look it up on the Internet . It s like it s an endless loop . It s like a snake with its tail in its mouth . Or a man with his head up his own ass . Trump and his minions have been pushing the lie about Clinton s health for weeks now . Fox News host Sean Hannity started this witch hunt when he interpreted a video of Hillary being playful and joking around as her having seizures , something which a real journalist who has real seizures called him out for in Newsweek.And then Giuliani started peddling the conspiracy theory despite the fact that it has been thoroughly debunked . Even Hillary s own doctor released a detailed statement on her overall health.Colbert opined that Giuliani and Trump know so much about Hillary s health because they are experts on female anatomy , which he proved by showing a video of Giuliani dressed in drag being motorboated by the Republican nominee . You re going to want to verify that video . Just go online and put down Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani motorboat , Colbert quipped.But Colbert saved the most devastating diagnosis for last , and let s just say the truth is going to hurt Trump and Giuliani below the belt . I don t know why they keep saying things like frail or weak or low-energy . You re just tip-toeing around the medical condition that you re really upset about . One that she has that no other president in history has ever faced . Hillary Clinton has chronic no penis . Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans need to stop peddling their false claims about Hillary s health . They are not real doctors and claiming that every little twitch or cough somehow disqualifies her from being president is completely asinine . FDR suffered from polio and led the nation through the Great Depression and World War II and served longer than any other president in American history . Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke while in office and served out his second term . Dwight Eisenhower had a serious heart attack in 1955 and a mild stroke in 1957 but still was re-elected in 1956 and served his second term . Ronald Reagan underwent surgery several times to remove cancer.By Trump and Giuliani s logic , none of these men should have ever been president simply because of their various health problems , and those health issues were verifiable facts , not the garbage Republicans are claiming now about Hillary Clinton s health.Featured image via screen capture',\n",
       " 'Probably the most highly coveted endorsement by either Democratic Presidential candidate would be Senator Elizabeth Warren . Her popularity and leadership in the Senate against corporate influences and Wall Street have made her a household name since President Barack Obama asked the former Harvard Law Professor to assist with Wall Street reform following the 2008 economic recession.After Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard ( D-HI ) resigned from her position as Vice Chair at the DNC in order to endorse Bernie Sanders , and after progressive champion Congressman Alan Grayson ( D-FL ) also endorsed Sanders today , the pressure is on for Senator Elizabeth Warren to either endorse a presidential candidate or not.Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders have speculated Senator Warren s neutrality is a sign of allegiance to their favored candidate . Warren s ideals more closely align with Senator Bernie Sanders , and the two are often seen in the Senate in tandem fighting against corporate greed . Just this past November , they were the only senators disputing Barack Obama s nominee to head the FDA over his ties to big pharmaceutical companies.Senator Warren has remained silent on the issue of an endorsement , but has remained as vocal as ever on the issues important to progressives . Today , an op-ed she wrote was published in the Boston Globe on how to level the playing field for working families in regards to the Family and Medical Leave Act . Both Sanders and Clinton support 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.Senator Warren s neutrality is most likely attributed to maintain the Democratic Party s integrity , as her endorsement would further divide a party already under pressure from the rift between Clinton and Sanders supporters . A Sanders endorsement would likely alienate Senator Warren from the Democratic Establishment , which has embraced her notoriety , and also embitter her supporters who preferred Clinton over Sanders.A Clinton endorsement would have similar consequences , but most likely negatively influence the Sanders campaign more than it would Clinton s campaign , as the failure of the Sanders campaign to receive an endorsement from arguably the most progressive in the Senate aside from Sanders would be a major setback . Senator Warren is also still a viable candidate for Vice President for either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders , and regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination , Senator Warren will likely serve an important role if they win the presidency as she has in the Obama administration.If Senator Warren were to make an endorsement , the best time would be today or tomorrow , as Massachusetts , and her home state of Oklahoma hold their primaries on Super Tuesday tomorrow , and the longer she waits to make a decision , the less influence she would have on pushing for her choice as the nominee .

       " 'NEW DELHI - A dozen Arab ambassadors have asked India to clarify its position on the U.S recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital , diplomatic sources said , after New Delhi s muted response suggested a shift in support for the Palestinian cause . U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital , generating outrage from Palestinians . Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv . Countries around the world , including U.S. allies Britain and France , criticized Trump s decision , but India did not take sides . Instead , the Indian foreign ministry in a brief statement , said India s position was consistent and independent of any third party . The bland statement made no reference to Jerusalem and prompted criticism at home that it was insufficient , vague and anti-Palestinian . Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital . Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and say Trump s move has left them marginalized and jeopardized any hopes of a two-state solution . Last week , envoys from Arab states including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Kuwait based in New Delhi met Indian junior foreign minister M.J. Akbar to brief the government about an Arab League meeting on Dec. 9 condemning the U.S. decision , a diplomatic and an Indian government source said . The envoys also sought a more forthright Indian response , the sources said . But Akbar gave no assurance and the Indian source said the government had no plans for a further articulation on Jerusalem , which is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Akbar did not promise anything , the diplomatic source briefed on the meeting said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities . India was one of the earliest and vocal champions of the Palestinian cause during the days it was leading the Non-Aligned Movement while it quietly pursued ties with Israel . But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , New Delhi has moved to a more open relationship with Israel , lifting the curtain on thriving military ties and also homeland security cooperation . Modi s Hindu nationalist ruling group views Israel and India as bound together in a common fight against Islamist militancy and long called for a public embrace of Israel . Modi in July made a first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister and did not go to Ramallah , the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for leaders trying to maintain a balance in political ties . P.R . Kumaraswamy , a leading Indian expert on ties with Israel at New Delhi s Jawaharlal Nehru University , said a major shift on India s policy had been evident since early this year when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visited New Delhi . With the Palestinian president standing by his side , Prime Minister Modi reiterated India s support for Palestinian statehood but carefully avoided any direct reference to East Jerusalem , he said . For decades , India s support for a Palestinian state was accompanied by an explicit reference to East Jerusalem being the Palestinian capital . But Delhi has moved to a more balanced position , refusing to take sides in an explosive dispute , he said . During the meeting last week , the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Somalia and the Palestinian Authority spoke , the diplomatic source said . Besides the dozen envoys there were charges d affaires from several other countries in the region . They were expecting more from India , perhaps to denounce Israel and the U.S. said former Indian ambassador to Jordan and Anil Trigunayat . But would it really make a difference , adding one more voice ?',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Three Republican U.S. senators warned Thursday they would not vote for a slimmed-down Obamacare repeal bill without guarantees that the House of Representatives will go into negotiations with the Senate on the measure .

       " 'VIENNA - The OSCE s media watchdog said on Thursday moves by the United States and Russia to force some foreign media to register as foreign agents were unacceptable and dangerous . Russia s lower house of parliament this week approved a law allowing Moscow to force foreign media to describe news they provide to Russians as the work of foreign agents and to disclose their funding sources . Earlier on Thursday Russia named nine U.S. government-sponsored news outlets likely to be labeled foreign agents . U.S. intelligence officials accuse the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters . Washington has required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a foreign agent . Branding media entities as foreign agents is a dangerous practice , as it can narrow the space for freedom of the media , said Harlem Desir , media freedom chief of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . The OSCE , which also oversees election monitoring , is one of the few security forums which brings Russia and the United States to the same table . It has a 700-strong observer mission monitoring the conflict in Ukraine . I call on both the Unites States and the Russian Federation to reconsider and refrain from requiring media entities to register as foreign agents , Desir said in a statement , labeling both countries moves as not acceptable . The Kremlin denies meddling in the U.S. election and has said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States amount to an attack on free speech . The new media law in Russia is retaliation , it says .',\n",
       " 'In a lame effort to score political points for Hillary Clinton , the New York Times published a portion of Donald Trump s 1995 tax return .

Does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage ? Isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it ! I would question Trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes ! The front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue , representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate Donald Trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.The anti-Trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of : could have , might be , may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative . Journalistic narratives are rarely based on facts.The identified $ 916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of Amazon , Facebook , Twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.Actually , Donald Trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the New York Times reported when it sold the Boston Globe in 2013 for a net loss of $ 1.03 billion.The Times purchased the Boston Globe in 93 for $ 1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $ 70 million , a loss of $ 1.03 billion .

       " 'MADRID - Spain on Friday sacked Catalonia s regional government , dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21 , in a bid to draw a line under the country s worst political crisis in 40 years . Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days . Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including regional president Carles Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region . Central government ministries assumed the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21 . It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis . An opinion poll published by El Mundo on Sunday showed that pro-independence parties may lose their parliamentary majority and even arrive behind anti-independence forces . The vote could result into a hung parliament . Other opinion polls have also shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters . Catalonia s main secessionist groups have called for widespread civil disobedience . They also instructed civil servants not to obey orders from Madrid and respond with peaceful resistance . It is unclear whether such calls will be followed or not . A key test will be when 200,000 civil servants return to work on Monday . [ L8N1N40ZQ ] Spain s government said it was not planning to make any arrests , but it is unclear how it will proceed if the current regional administration staff refuse to leave their offices . None of the immediate Catalan cabinet , including Puigdemont , are thought to have spent the weekend in the Barcelona central offices and it is unclear if they will attempt to return to work on Monday . A growing number of analysts have feared this could lead to a physical confrontation if national police , who used heavy-handed tactics to thwart an Oct. 1 vote on independence , seek to intervene . One of the main problems over the implementation of direct rule will relate to Catalonia s own police forces , the Mossos d Esquadra . On Saturday , the Mossos chief Josep Lluis Trapero was fired . The new chief told officers they should remain neutral . In an open letter on Sunday , Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido praised the Mossos for their work and urged them to accept temporary direction from Madrid . But a group of Mossos favoring independence had previously said they would not follow instructions from the central government and would not use force to remove ministers and lawmakers from power . Several officers told they believed the 17,000-strong force was split between those who want independence and those who oppose it . The Mossos , whose former chief is under investigation on suspicion of sedition , will have to act on direct orders from their new bosses . If deemed necessary , Mossos officers may be replaced by national police . The economy and budget ministries took full control over regional finances on Friday . Many companies have however said on condition of anonymity that they feared a new Catalan treasury could start levying taxes , and that they would seek to move their tax base outside Catalonia . It is also possible that some pro-independence Catalans will stop paying their taxes to the Spanish treasury . The Spanish government had initially said it would control widely watched Catalan public television TV3 , but it eventually dropped that plan . The media is likely to play an important role in the run-up to the new election in Catalonia .',\n",

       " 'GENEVA - Syrian refugees could again seek to reach Europe in droves if aid programs are not sustained in five neighboring countries hosting the bulk of them , the United Nations said on Tuesday . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) was giving details of the $ 4.4 billion appeal to support 5.3 million Syrian refugees in surrounding countries as well as to host communities in Turkey , Lebanon , Iraq , Jordan and Egypt that have taken them in . The agency , which has received only 53 percent of its $ 4.63 billion appeal for 2017 , needs international support , Amin Awad , director of UNHCR s Middle East and North Africa bureau , told a news briefing . He listed many reasons , including : The vast number of refugees that we have in the region , the geopolitical status of that region , the risk that a population of 5.3 million people can bring to an area , a small region already volatile as it is , if there is no assistance . We had the experience of 2015 , we don t want to repeat that , he said . The lack of funding led to an acute shortage of services that year , when one million refugees fled to Europe , he added . About half were Syrians , UNHCR figures show . An EU-Turkey deal has largely halted the flow , but a UNHCR funding shortfall has led to fresh cutbacks in vital programs providing food , health care , education and shelter to Syrian refugees , Awad said . That means we re not able to provide stoves , we are not able to deliver kerosene , we are not able to deliver enough thermal blankets , we are not able to winterise tents , we are not able to drain water and snow from camps , we are not able to do engineering work to insulate some of the buildings . People are sitting in cold , open buildings , he said . Turkey currently hosts 3.3 million Syrian refugees , the largest number , followed by Lebanon with one million . These are the biggest donors , these are the real donors . They provided space , international protection , Awad said . Now the material assistance is left to the donors and international community ... And that s not coming through . So we have to be prepared for consequences , he said . Awad , asked about countries in the region closing their borders to Syrian refugees , replied : Borders are managed , in some instance are closed . Host countries have cited concerns over security , economic crises , and xenophobia , but Syrians continue to arrive , he said . Lebanon is still accepting vulnerable cases , medical cases , so is Turkey , Awad said . There have been cases of refoulement , returning refugees to places where they could face war or persecution , in violation of law , he said . We are seeing expulsion , we are seeing people sent back . UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards declined to provide specifics on Syrian refugees being expelled .',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - With no palatable military options , U.S. President Donald Trump may ultimately have no choice but to give diplomacy a chance to end the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs . For now , though , he is pursuing tougher economic sanctions , including an oil embargo , and opposed to making any concessions that might look like appeasement , insisting that more pressure on the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is needed before it is time to talk . North Korea seems even more opposed to negotiations until it has achieved the ability to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons . North Korea is not interested in dialogue . ... Kim Jong Un has sent a message with this last test that he doesn t listen to anybody , said a senior official who helps coordinate the European Union s North Korea policy . So for now , despite calls from Russia , China , and others , there is no push from the United States or North Korea for direct talks , despite an escalating crisis that threatens millions of lives after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend . The Trump administration says the United Nations needs to tighten economic sanctions to pressure North Korea to change its behavior and start talking . A draft sanctions resolution was circulated to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday . Trump s tactics , one senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity , mirror those in many of his business deals : simultaneously playing good cop and bad cop , not appearing too interested in making a deal but keeping lines of communication open . Trump said on Wednesday after a call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that military action against North Korea was not a first choice , but we will see what happens . Nikki Haley , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said on Sunday that Kim was begging for war , but added : The time has come for us to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it s too late . The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea , ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban , according to a draft resolution seen by on Wednesday . It was not immediately clear if the draft had the support of North Korean ally China , which along with Russia , while denouncing the latest test , has said that resolving the nuclear crisis is impossible with sanctions and pressure alone . [ L4N1LN25F ] A decade of sanctions has not slowed North Korea s nuclear weapons program , and now that it is closer to its goal , diplomats and analysts say it is unlikely to back down . The U.S. policy of strategic patience on North Korea has assumed that time is on their side - that economic sanctions will eventually lead to the collapse of Kim Jong Un s regime and its economy , and it will come to the negotiating table , no longer able to withstand the economic pain , said Moon Chung-in , a special adviser to South Korea s president on foreign affairs and national security . However , such an assumption has now proven wrong . North Korea s economy has not only adapted quickly to tightening sanctions , but the country has also succeeded in advancing its nuclear weapons programs despite more than a decade of economic hardship . Zhao Tong , a Beijing-based North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center , said Pyongyang may hope Washington ultimately will recognize it has developed a credible nuclear capability , abandon its long-standing precondition for talks - that North Korea accept that they be aimed at its nuclear disarmament - and instead seek the freezing its nuclear program . From the North Korean perspective , their strategy is working , he said . Most experts say it no longer is realistic to think North Korea will trade away its nuclear arsenal in exchange for sanctions relief , economic support , or a peace treaty with the United States ending the formal state of war that has existed since the 1950-53 Korean War . Robert Einhorn , a former senior U.S. non-proliferation specialist now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington , said North Korea has learned from the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi s decision to stop developing weapons of mass destruction that you can t give up critical assets that you need for your own survival . China has put forth a freeze-for-freeze proposal that would suspend large-scale U.S. military exercises with South Korea in return for a suspension of North Korean nuclear and missile tests . Washington continues to reject that idea . But the longer diplomacy is delayed , the greater the chances that North Korea can master the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear-tipped missiles , and then enter talks from a position of strength . South Korea is keeping open the option of dialogue with North Korea , and hopes Washington and Seoul can develop a diplomatic roadmap , Cho Hyun , South Korea s second Vice Foreign Minister , said at a seminar in Washington on Tuesday . It may sound unrealistic today , but we can not abandon it .',\n",

Clinton leads Sanders 48 percent to 45 percent among Democratic voters , according to the poll of 512 Americans , conducted Feb. 2-5 following the Iowa caucus . The poll has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points . Democrats had been supporting Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin at the beginning of the year . Sanders has narrowed that lead considerably over the past several weeks . Clinton beat Sanders narrowly in the Iowa caucuses , the nation ’ s first nomination contest ahead of the November election , but is expected to lose to him in New Hampshire . The two rivals clashed on Thursday night in their first one-on-one debate , reflecting the tightness of the race . There is still a wide gap between the two in name recognition nationally .

       " 'CARACAS - President Nicolas Maduro defended Venezuela ’ s “ secure ” election system on Tuesday as opponents struggled to present a united front over allegations of fraud in a nationwide vote surprisingly won by the ruling socialists . Despite widespread anger over economic hardship , the Socialist Party confounded opinion polls to take 17 of 23 governorships in Sunday ’ s election . Stunned by the defeat that undermines their aim to win the presidency in 2018 , the opposition Democratic Unity coalition refused to acknowledge the results and called the election rigged , as did the United States . Though the coalition has complained of an unfair playing field - from abuse of state resources to last-minute moving of vote centers away from opposition strongholds - it has not given detailed evidence of ballot-tampering . Some opposition figures have acknowledged abstention by their supporters - disillusioned by the failure of street protests to dislodge Maduro earlier this year - was a big factor . Two losing opposition candidates , Henri Falcon in Lara state and Alejandro Feo La Cruz in Carabobo , have conceded defeat , breaking with the official coalition position . Both criticized “ irregularities ” in the vote but also lamented many demoralized opposition supporters stayed at home . “ We need courage to recognize truth in adversity , ” said Falcon . The strongest criticism of Sunday ’ s vote came from Washington , which slammed Maduro ’ s “ dictatorship. ” Several European nations also expressed concern , while 12 countries in the Americas from the so-called Lima Group condemned “ obstacles , intimidation , manipulation and irregularities ” . Washington is considering further sanctions on Venezuela , after various measures against top officials and the economy earlier this year , while the European Union is mulling the same . Government leaders have smarted at fraud accusations . “ Venezuela ’ s election system is the most secure and audited in the world , ” Maduro said on Tuesday . “ President Donald Trump , I am not a dictator ; I am a humble worker ... I have a moustache and look like Stalin , but I ’ m not him. ” The Venezuelan leader invited EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to visit or receive him in Brussels to “ open their eyes , ” and told “ stupid ” Canada to stop meddling . Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza later said on Twitter that Maduro had recalled Venezuela ’ s ambassador to Canada for talks . Heaping further humiliation on Venezuela ’ s opposition , the governors were due to be sworn in on Tuesday by a new legislative superbody elected controversially in July . The opposition boycotted that vote and has refused to recognize the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly , which supersedes all institutions including the opposition-controlled congress . The opposition ’ s five governors-elect planned to boycott the swearing-in ceremony , defying Maduro ’ s threat to bar them from office for failing to accept the assembly as a higher authority . “ We will not kneel to anyone , ” said Juan Pablo Guanipa , who won the oil-rich western Zulia state . Despite food shortages , runaway inflation and a tanking currency , Venezuela ’ s government retains significant bastions of support , especially in poorer , rural parts of the country . In his news conference , Maduro said the socialists also won Bolivar state , which would take its total to 18 governorships versus five for the opposition . The government won a total of 54 percent of the votes overall , he added . The election board has not confirmed the Bolivar result or the overall vote figures . With the opposition coalition ’ s dozens of parties arguing over whether there was fraud , what went wrong , and where to go next , it will need to regroup and map strategy quickly heading into the 2018 presidential campaign . Its very future may even be in doubt , since many young activists who took to the streets for four straight months of protests and pitched battles with security forces earlier this year feel betrayed by their leaders . The unrest killed at least 125 people . Maduro has long accused opposition leaders of being behind violence , and on Tuesday called the new opposition governor of Zulia state a “ fascist ” while accusing his counterpart in Tachira of links to Colombian “ paramilitaries. ” The election aftermath appears to have sunk a government-opposition mediation effort that began last month in the Dominican Republic . Even though Maduro wants to resuscitate the talks , the opposition coalition has ruled that out . “ We are the majority , the dictatorship is more-and-more illegitimate , popular and global condemnation grows daily against this regime , ” it said in a communique late on Monday .',\n",
       " 'BERLIN - A man drove a car at the entrance of the Berlin headquarters of Germany s Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) late on Sunday evening , lightly injuring himself , later telling police that he had intended to commit suicide . Police said the car , which crashed through the first set of glass doors of Willy Brandt House , the SPD s headquarters , was laden with petrol canisters and gas cartridges . The building s sprinkler system extinguished the resulting blaze . Authorities did not identify the man , in part because of a policy of limiting public communications in cases involving suicide , attempted or otherwise , saying only that he was 58 years old . A police spokeswoman said investigators had found nothing to cast doubt on the man s claim that he had been attempting to commit suicide . The incident did not appear to be an attack , she added . It was unclear why he had chosen the SPD , which is about to start negotiations on governing for another four years in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives , as his target . The man was taken to hospital for treatment for superficial injuries to his head . Nobody else was hurt . Police launched an arson inquiry and state security services were also investigating .',\n",
       " 'After an epic Twitter tantrum in which he yelled at Puerto Rico for being knocked down by two hurricanes and cried giant crocodile tears about fake news , Trump decided he d try shaming the NFL with a video from an NHL game . At that game , the audience stands up and sings the national anthem . One might think that this just happened , but it didn t. The video in question is almost a year old.19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem ! # StandForOurAnthem ? ? pic.twitter.com/czutyGaMQV Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 1 , 2017The original video is on NHL on NBC Sports Facebook page , dated Nov. 9 , 2016 . The day after the election that gave us this walking shitshow to begin with . Why does this matter ? Because Trump is still going on about NFL players kneeling during the anthem on Twitter . Earlier today , in the midst of all the ranting about nobody giving him his due credit for the farce of a relief effort in Puerto Rico , he tweeted this : Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow , and always , for the playing of our National Anthem . Respect our Flag and our Country ! Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 30 , 2017He brought the issue into sharp relief last week when he went on a tear about disrespect to the flag and called on NFL owners to fire players who won t stand . Many NFL players retaliated by kneeling , the Pittsburgh Steelers didn t even come out of the locker room , and many owners issued statements rebuking Trump in one way or another.So Trump , in an attempt to shame what the NFL is doing now , shares a video that s a year old . In truth , the NHL seems rather split on how they feel about kneeling during the national anthem . There are , however , several players and coaches who believe it s everyone s right to protest how they see fit , as part of the First Amendment . Trump just embarrassed the hell out of himself.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'We ve all had questions about Huma Abedin but did you know how connected she is to the Saudi government ? Does anyone doubt that the Saudis are bankrolling everything the Clintons do ? The information below is fantastic and should be seen by anyone even remotely considering voting for Hillary Clinton . Huma Abedin is the definition of shady ! The mainstream media has done nothing to seriously vet the connection between the Clinton and Saudi Arabia , and the key role Huma Abedin plays in the life and work of Hillary Clinton are one core link . Abedin not only lived in Saudi Arabia from the time she was two years old , but her mother currently lives in Saudi Arabia and runs the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs as well as being a dean at a woman s college there.Despite the fawning coverage she has received , there are many unanswered questions about Abedin , especially given her complete access to Hillary Clinton , one of the most powerful people in the world , a former Secretary of State and possible future president . As Vanity Fair William Cohan writes in his piece : Over the years Huma has served in several positions , with increasingly important-sounding titles . She has been Hillary s body woman , her traveling chief of staff , a senior adviser , and a deputy chief of staff when Hillary was secretary of state . Now , based in Brooklyn , she is the vice-chair of Hillary s 2016 presidential campaign.The Facts about Huma Abedin and Abdullah Omar Nasseef To his credit , Cohan s Vanity Fair piece on the secretive Abedin confirms a number of facts that have been reported by conservative media for a couple of years but have been twisted and convoluted by the mainstream media.For example , the Vanity Fair article flatly lays out the information that Huma Abedin was an assistant editor at a publication called the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs from 1996 until 2008 . He writes : When ( Huma ) Abedin was two years old , the family moved to Jidda , Saudi Arabia , where , with the backing of Abdullah Omar Nasseef , then the president of King Abdulaziz University , her father founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs , a think tank , and became the first editor of its Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs , which stated its mission as shedding light on minority Muslim communities around the world in the hope of securing the legitimate rights of these communities . It turns out the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs is an Abedin family business . Huma was an assistant editor there between 1996 and 2008 . Her brother , Hassan , 45 , is a book-review editor at the Journal and was a fellow at the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies , where Nasseef is chairman of the board of trustees . Huma s sister , Heba , 26 , is an assistant editor at the Journal.As the masthead of this 1996 issue of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs shows , Huma Abedin was an assistant editor at Journal . Down the masthead you can see the name of Abdullah Omar Nasseef.Aside from helping found the Abedin s family business it s beyond dispute that Abdullah Omar Nasseef was the secretary-general of a group called the Muslim World League . That s not controversial and Cohan does acknowledge this in Vanity Fair : In his early years as the patron of the Abedins journal , Nasseef was the secretary-general of the Muslim World League , which Andrew McCarthy , the former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the Blind Sheik , Omar Abdel Rahman , in the wake of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , claims has long been the Muslim Brotherhood s principal vehicle for the international propagation of Islamic supremacist ideology . Although it describes itself a nongovernment organization , the Muslim World League is an effectively an arm of the Saudi Arabian government . As a lawsuit posted on the Philadelphia Enquirer website states a full time employee of the Muslim World League testified as follows : Let me tell you one thing , the Muslim World League , which is the mother of IIRO ( International Islamic Relief Organization ) is a fully government funded organization . In other words , I work for the government of Saudi Arabia . I am an employee of that government.Second , the IIRO is the relief branch of that organization which means that we are controlled in all of our activities and plans by the government of Saudi Arabia.Keep that in mind , please I am paid by my organization which is funded by the [ Saudi ] government the [ IIRO ] office , like any other office in the world , here or in the Muslim World League , has to abide by the policy of the government of Saudi Arabia . If anybody deviates from that , he would be fired ; he would not work at all with IIRO or with the Muslim World League.According to the group s own website , the Muslim World League : is engaged in propagating the religion of Islam , elucidating its principles and tenets , refuting suspicious and false allegations made against the religion . The League also strives to persuade people to abide by the commandments of their Lord , and to keep away from prohibited deeds . The League is also ready to help Muslims solve problems facing them anywhere in the world , and carry out their projects in the sphere of Da wah , education and culture . The League , which employs all means that are not at variance with the Sharia ( Islamic law ) to further its aims , is well known for rejecting all acts of violence and promoting dialogue with the people of other cultures.The group s claim about rejecting all acts of violence is specious given its connection to the Saudi government and the Kingdom s advocacy for sharia law , which it practices with gusto.Desperate to retain the Saudi royal family s iron grip , Saudi Arabia banned all public gatherings . The Saudi Arabian government uses both public beheading and crucifixion as punishments , for example , and in 2012 sentenced a 16-year-old who d protested against the government to both . Saudi Arabia recently sparked international outrage when it executed over 40 people deemed terrorists . Many were beheaded.Following 9/11 , the Saudis came under intense government scrutiny for their role in funding terror through ostensively charitable groups . In 2007 , ABC News reported Saudis Still Filling Al Qaeda s Coffers : Despite six years of promises , U.S. officials say Saudi Arabia continues to look the other way at wealthy individuals identified as sending millions of dollars to al Qaeda . If I could somehow snap my fingers and cut off the funding from one country , it would be Saudi Arabia , Stuart Levey , the under secretary of the Treasury in charge of tracking terror financing , told ABC News.The mainstream media has done nothing to serious vet the connection between the Clinton and Saudi Arabia , and the key role Huma Abedin plays in the life and work of Hillary Clinton are one core link . Abedin not only lived in Saudi Arabia from the time she was two years old , but her mother currently lives in Saudi Arabia and runs the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs as well as being a dean at a woman s college there.Further tying the Clintons to the Saudis is big money . CNN reported in 2008 that donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $ 10 million to $ 25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Vanity Fair points out Huma s ties there after Clinton left her role as Secretary of State : In addition to the State Department and Teneo jobs , Huma was hired as a consultant to the William J. Clinton Foundation to help plan for Hillary s post-State philanthropic activities , and as a personal employee of Hillary s.The Saudis have denied the accusation they ve funded terrorism and also say they complied with U.S. orders , telling ABC that after the Sept. 11 attacks , the country took prompt action and required Saudi banks to identify and freeze all assets relating to terrorist suspects and entities per the list issued by the United States government . One of the organizations specifically singled out for funding terrorism was founded by the Abedin family benefactor . In 1988 , Naseef also founded the charitable giving arm of the Muslim World League , an entity called Rabita Trust.Remember the League s connection to the Saudis as stated earlier and it s clear that Naseef was not a loose cannon but effectively acting as an employee of the Kingdom.One of the other founders of the Rabita Trust was Wa el Hamza Julaidan , who that same year would also become one of the four founders of Al Qaeda . In 1984 , Julaidan had worked with Osama bin Laden to set up mujahedin training camps in Afghanistan . As U.S. News reported in 2003 : Afghanistan forged not only financial networks but important bonds among those who believe in violent jihad . During the Afghan war , the man who ran the Muslim World League office in Peshawar , Pakistan , was bin Laden s mentor , Abdullah Azzam . Another official there was Wael Julaidan , a Saudi fundraiser who would join bin Laden in founding al Qaeda in 1988 . Documents seized in raids after 9/11 reveal just how close those ties were . One record , taken from a Saudi-backed charity in Bosnia , bears the handwritten minutes of a meeting between bin Laden and three men , scrawled beneath the letterhead of the IIRO and Muslim World League . The notes call for the opening of league offices . . . for the Pakistanis , so that attacks can be made from them . A note on letterhead of the Saudi Red Crescent Saudi Arabia s Red Cross in Peshawar asks that weapons be inventoried . It is accompanied by a plea from bin Laden to Julaidan , citing an extreme need for weapons . Shortly after the 9/11 attacks , the government froze the assets of the Rabita Trust for funding terrorism . As the New York Times reported in October , 2001 : The Bush administration vowed today to seize the assets of more individuals it says support terrorism , including a prominent businessman from Saudi Arabia , a United States ally whose reluctance to move against people and groups with ties to Osama bin Laden has become a politically sensitive Also on the list is Rabita Trust , a Pakistani charity that at least until recently had Pakistan s president , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , on its board . Administration officials said they warned President Musharraf of the impending order against the Rabita Trust and encouraged him to disassociate himself from what they described as its founder s links to Al Qaeda , Mr. bin Laden s terrorist network.In March , 2002 federal law-enforcement officials conducted raids on 15 organizations that the Treasury Department suspected of laundering money . The New York Times reported : One other place searched today was the office of the International Islamic Relief Organization at 360 South Washington Street in Falls Church , Va. , another Washington suburb.That charity has a parent , the Muslim World League , that officials said was also searched . Corporate records show that the Muslim World League , which is financed in part by the Saudi government , is based at the same address as the relief organization , in Falls Church , but that it has used the Herndon building as a mailing address.Last October , the Treasury Department listed another Islamic charity financed by the Muslim World League , the Rabita Trust , as having connections to Al Qaeda.The connection of Abdullah Omar Nasseef to terror funding in general and Al Qaeda specifically is clear and convincing ; just as clear and persuading as his connection to the Abedin family is.The Muslim World League was the mother organization of two groups the government believed were involved in funneling money to terrorists the Rabita Trust and the International Islamic Relief Organization ( IIRO ) . Both groups are listed on the Treasury department s website . Both Naseef s co-founder Wa el Hamza Julaidan himself and the Rabita Trust as an organization were placed by lists of terror funders by both the United States and the United Nations.The Treasury Department met cited the Rabita Trust for providing logistical and financial support to al Qaida . The Treasury Department s discussion of the IIRO goes into detail about the money and logistics support they provided terror groups and includes information that shows that these provide both legitimate charity services but also act as a money laundering operation to get funds to terror groups : International Islamic Relief Organization ( IIRO ) The IIRO was established in 1978 and , according to its website , the organization has branch offices in over 20 countries in Africa , Europe , Asia , and the Middle East.Abd Al Hamid Sulaiman Al-Mujil ( Al-Mujil ) is the Executive Director of the IIRO Eastern Province ( IIRO-EP ) branch office in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Al-Mujil has been called the million dollar man for supporting Islamic militant groups . Al-Mujil provided donor funds directly to al Qaida and is identified as a major fundraiser for the Abu Sayyaf Group ( ASG ) and Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) .Read more : Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'As a mother of three young girls , if anything like this were to happen to one of my daughters in a bathroom , dressing room or shower that is open to potential rapists and pedophiles by a company like say Target they would be looking at massive law suit , as I would consider them an accomplice to the crime.A Pennsylvania man who was arrested for taking photos of a 10-year-old girl in a public restroom has now also been hit with child porn charges , police report.Quarryville , PA , resident James Thomas Shoemaker , 19 , was arrested last week when he was found hiding in a stall of the woman s bathroom in the Sheetz store on Manheim Pike . Police said he was taking images of young girls on his cell phone.The arrest comes as progressives step up their judicial and media push to force American adults and youths to share all of their public bathrooms and changing rooms with the small number of people who try to live and look like people of the opposite sex . In mid-April , for example , Target stores announced they would only allow mixed-sex changing rooms and toilets . On April 21 , media outlets claimed that Donald Trump supported the progressive campaign to eliminate single-sex bathrooms.In fact , Trump backs the current live-and-let-live policy favored by most Americans , in which they willingly tolerate the quiet use of normal bathrooms by people of the opposite sex . There s a big move to create new bathrooms for transgender [ people ] that would be discriminatory in a certain way [ and ] that would be unbelievably expensive for businesses in the country , Trump said April 21 . Leave it the way it is , he added.In Quarryville , the suspect was accused of entering the women s restroom and staying there for about an hour . Police also said that while in the facility he looked at pornography on his cell phone and then used his phone to take photos of a child who entered the room . The child alleged that Shoemaker held his cell phone over the top of the stall she was in and recorded her activities.Shoemaker consented to allowing police to look through the images on his cell phone whereupon they discovered nude photos of his girlfriend . But police also learned that the girlfriend is only 16 and now they ve hit the suspect with a felony child pornography charge on top of the third degree misdemeanor invasion of privacy charge he was already facing.The arrest in Pennsylvania comes about two weeks after the arrest of a man in California who was dressed as a woman and caught taking video of women in a Macy s store women s restroom .

The suit seeks an order forcing Selleck to stop using the district s water , plus reimbursement for the $ 21,685.55 it paid the investigator , with damages and other costs.But the suit is a civil action , not a criminal case . Ventura County sheriff s Capt . John Riley meanwhile told NBC News that the sheriff s office did investigate allegations of criminal water theft , but we are unable to establish a crime was committed . The Ventura County district attorney s office also confirmed that no case has been referred to it for prosecution.Selleck hasn t responded to requests for comment , and it s unknown whether he has anything to do with the water truck , which is registered under a commercial license.Eric Bergh , the water district s manager of resources , said the suit wasn t meant to be an example of drought shaming , a peculiarly California activity in which people suspected of hogging water are publicly called out .

       " 'Republican presidential candidate and current Ohio governor John Kasich made strange remarks about sexual assault during a town hall event in New York . Kasich echoed many conservatives and laid the blame on women for these crimes.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=X8FqEIgQMW0Asked about the risk of campus sexual assault during a Friday campaign event , Ohio Gov . John Kasich ( R ) advised a female student not to go to parties where there s a lot of alcohol . The Republican presidential candidate was hosting a town hall in Watertown , New York when a freshman student from St. Lawrence University asked how he would help her feel safer and more secure regarding sexual violence , harassment , and rape , according to ABC News.Simply going to a party where there s a lot of alcohol is not any kind of excuse for a woman being assaulted . Yet conservatives , who repeatedly have denied that there is a rape culture on many college campuses , have regularly cited how women are dressed or what sort of parties they attend when addressing this vital issue.By comparison , the Obama administration launched the It s On Us initiative to highlight the role men have to play in stopping sexual assault on campus . Vice President Joe Biden , who helped to author the Violence Against Women Act has often served as a spokesperson for the initiative.Despite the conservative pushback , progressive groups spearheaded by women s leadership have placed campus sexual assault on the top tier of issues to be dealt with by college officials as well as elected officials at the local , state , and federal levels.Increasingly views like Governor Kasich s that put the onus of responsibility on female victims are becoming the minority , while fathers , sons , and brothers have come to realize that blame is a weak and ineffective response.Republicans have found out more often than not , that their insensitive remarks about rape , abortion , and other issues affecting women have fed into the larger story of a war on women , and they end up losing elections .

       " 'Another day , another Democrat who is backing the nominee for the Supreme Court seat that the Senate Republicans stole from President Obama . We have previously reported on how traitorous Democrats like Joe Manchin ( DINO-WV ) and Heidi Heitcamp ( DINO-ND ) have turned tail and voted with Republicans on many issues most notably falling in line with Republicans in order to confirm right-wing potential Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch . Now , we have a third to add to that list : Joe Donnelly of Indiana . Donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue : After meeting with Judge Gorsuch , conducting a thorough review of his record , and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers . The only redeeming statement Donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the Senate should still have a 60-vote threshold when it comes to confirming Gorsuch or any other nominee for the Supreme Court . That is paramount , because it means that there is a true bipartisan Senate consensus for the Court s nominations and confirmations , which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary.Of course , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cares not one whit about that ; he and his fellow GOP cronies have insisted that Gorsuch will be on the Court one way or another . This means he is willing to breach the 60-vote rule to make sure Gorsuch makes it to the Supreme Court . What the Republicans did to President Obama s nominee Merrick Garland is a travesty and a disgrace , and the Democrats should do the same for Gorsuch . For those who won t PRIMARY THEM .

I didn t say a god damn word about abortion but you had to get your f * cking tighty whiteys in a bunch because an organization that you know nothing about is doing good things for millions of people and you hate it . Shut your face up about shit you don t understand you f * cking dump truck . Abortion is murder , just because they re in the womb doesn t change the fact you re killing an innocent human being , the right-wing troll continued to insist . As I said , it s not a faceless organization s job to provide sex ed while simultaneously killing unborn children . The right-wing troll has slapped Damien with a glove so he picked up a gauntlet and smacked back on behalf of women everywhere . Listen up kiddo : Abortion isn t murder . Murder is illegal . Abortion is not illegal . IE abortion is not murder . As I said ( and we ll go with what I said as not total bullshit because it s obvious you have absolutely no real knowledge when it comes to sex or reproduction and i think we can thank your parents for that ) this young man had a single mother that didn t feel comfortable talking to him about sex . So i did it . I provided medically accurate and up to date information unlike so many parents today . And by the way , planned parenthood isn t some shadowy faceless organization . For example , this is my face . The face i made while reading your stupid ass response .

       " '- Federal prosecutors on Friday opposed a last-ditch effort by New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez to allow periodic delays in his federal corruption trial in Newark , New Jersey , next month so that he can travel to Washington to cast critical Senate votes . U.S. District Judge William Walls on Tuesday had rejected Menendez ’ s request , saying the Democrat was free to “ absent himself ” from testimony but did not deserve special treatment , being “ no worse and no better than any other defendant. ” In a filing on Thursday , Menendez said his “ constitutional obligations ” to his constituents justified altering the trial schedule so he could vote on raising the debt ceiling to avoid a government shutdown , rewriting the tax code and renewing the soon-to-expire National Flood Insurance Program . Republicans have a narrow Senate majority , and Menendez said July ’ s failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act showed his absence from any vote could be “ potentially determinative. ” The trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 6 . Prosecutors on Friday said the scheduling conflicts resulted from Menendez ’ s lengthy , failed pursuit of a meritless argument that the Constitution immunized him from prosecution . “ No defendant should receive special treatment based on power or privilege , ” prosecutors said . “ This court should reject defendant Menendez ’ s effort to let politics in Washington dictate the trial schedule in Newark. ” Menendez later countered that U.S. Supreme Court precedents and “ common sense ” justified an accommodation . It is unclear when the judge will rule on Menendez ’ s request . The senator was charged with accepting campaign donations and gifts , including a stay at a Caribbean villa and private jet flights , from co-defendant Salomon Melgen in exchange for lobbying on the Florida eye doctor ’ s behalf . Both men have pleaded not guilty to fraud and bribery . Jury selection was completed on Wednesday . If Menendez were found guilty and removed from the Senate before New Jersey Governor Chris Christie completes his term on Jan. 16 , 2018 , then Christie , a Republican , could name a replacement . Christie ’ s successor could fill any subsequent vacancy . The case is U.S. v. Menendez et al , U.S. District Court , District of New Jersey , No . 15-cr-00155 .',\n",
       " 'It s not illegal , but it s long been considered unethical for journalists to pay their sources . It still happens , but generally by tabloids . WikiLeaks Julian Assange believes that his is not a tabloid , and in fact , he believes that he is so far above mainstream media sources , that it s okay for him to pay for stories , which is exactly what he s doing , trying to dig up dirt on both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump . Police rewards product results . So do journalistic rewards , a spokesperson for Sunshine Press , of which Wikileaks is a project , told Huffington Post in an email . Those who take the truth seriously leave no stone unturned to find it . As for the ethics , well , WikiLeaks breaths rarified air : Some lesser publications have poor quality control and as a consequence are not able to maintain accuracy when financial incentives are involved . Or frankly , even when they are not , the spokesperson said , pointing to the New York Times publishing false information about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction as an example . WikiLeaks vetting process is strong enough not to be affected by an increase in source contributions . Wait , what ? WikiLeaks has a vetting process ? This is the same organization that published more than 80 strains of malware in its most recent email dump . Oh , and there s a reason they re called email dumps WikiLeaks doesn t vet , they simply dump , leaving other journalists to sort through to find the real information . While the New York Times certainly doesn t deserve the level of respect they had before the Iraq War , I can say with certainty that they ve never infected my computer with malware.This isn t the first time WikiLeaks has paid to play . Last year , they offered $ 100,000 for information relating to the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . Earlier in the month , WikiLeaks offered $ 20,000 for anyone with information that might link the murder of a DNC staffer in Washington D.C. to the Hillary Clinton campaign . All they ended up doing was fueling Alex Jones-type conspiracy theorists.Assange has received a lot of criticism from those on the left , claiming that he s trying to put his thumb on the scale of our electoral process in an attempt to defeat Clinton . I m sure his claim that he s also going after Trump is a convincing cover for that , but think about it . Assange is offering $ 100,000 . Trump could easily double or triple that to keep someone quiet . Yes , the Clintons have money , but not Trump money.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images .',\n",

       " 'HOUSTON - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , while chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) , used an alias for emails with employees and board members because his primary account was jammed with too many messages , the oil company said on Tuesday . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change , wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson ’ s climate-change communications through it . Exxon denied trying to hide anything . “ This was not an alias used to discuss only climate change , ” Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Tuesday . “ It was an account used for everyday business by senior executives who needed to reach ” Tillerson , who left the company at the end of 2016 to become secretary of state . Tillerson received thousands of emails a day from climate change activists and others at his regular address - Rex.W.Tillerson @ ExxonMobil.com - and that made it difficult to parse which messages were important to promptly address Exxon ’ s business operations , Jeffers said . Tillerson used the email alias for eight years and sent thousands of messages . Sixty-four of those sent and received met the parameters for Schneiderman ’ s climate change subpoena and were turned over to New York officials , Jeffers said . The email alias was Wayne.Tracker @ ExxonMobil.com . Wayne is Tillerson ’ s middle name and “ Tracker ” is likely a reference to his past involvement in the Boy Scouts of America . Although Trump has vowed to reverse climate-change steps taken by former President Barack Obama , Exxon has said it believes it must address climate change . On Monday , it said : “ ExxonMobil believes the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action. ” Darren Woods , who succeeded Tillerson as Exxon ’ s CEO in January , does not use an email alias , nor does any other Exxon employee , Jeffers said . Use of the email alias was seized upon by environmentalists on Tuesday , who said it revealed a pattern of deception . “ If they had nothing to hide , than why the secret email account ? ” said Jamie Henn of 350.org , an environmental group . Exxon plans to respond to Schneiderman in a court filing within the next several days , Jeffers said .

       " 'ADDIS ABABA - The speaker of Ethiopia s lower house of parliament submitted his resignation on Sunday , one of the highest-ranking officials to do so since the ruling EPRDF coalition came to power in 1991 . Abadula Gemeda did not disclose reasons behind his decision , but said he would disclose the factors once his move was approved by parliament . Analysts in the Horn of Africa country said Abadula , an ethnic Oromo , may have decided to step down owing to disapproval of the government s response to unrest that roiled Ethiopia s Oromiya region in 2015 and 2016 . The violence there forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was only lifted in August . Given the existence of circumstances that do not enable me to continue in this position , I have submitted my resignation to my political party and the House of People s Representatives , he said in a short speech on national television . I will disclose the reasons behind my decision once my request is reviewed by the House of People s Representatives , the former defense minister added . The unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital Addis Ababa that dissidents said amounted to land grabs and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuses . It included attacks on businesses , many of them foreign-owned , including farms growing flowers for export . In April , a government-sanctioned investigation said 669 people had been killed during one period in the violence and more than 29,000 people arrested',\n",

It was issued by someone who is former MI6 and probably has his own style of header . That entire argument is dead from the get-go . But the post is from November 1 , you might say . Yes , this is true that the post predates the full release of the information , but Mother Jones has been reporting on this for longer than that .

No one has updated the story to name him as the source , so that s pretty well settled . Naturally , he included a stab at conservatives for calling this fake news while believing actual fake news : The real shame of this entire situation is that we re wasting valuable time Trump could be using to uncover the real secrets of John Podesta and Hillary Clinton s PizzaGate global child kidnapping and cannibalism ring .

He knows the destructive power of racist hatred first hand , and he is now warning about the forces that have been stirred up by the divisive presidential campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump . I ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did , Lewis said in an interview with The Times after speaking at Cal State L.A . I think demagogues are pretty dangerous , really . We shouldn t divide people , we shouldn t separate people . Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past . I heard it so much growing up in the South , he said . I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement . As a people , I just think we could do much better . Trump launched his campaign with a divisive message of racism , accusing Mexicans of being criminals and rapists . Since then , it has gotten worse . Trump-inspired thugs have attacked Latinos . His campaign supporters have on multiple occasions attacked black demonstrators at Trump s own rallies , sometimes egged on by the candidate himself . And Trump has also proposed a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.As former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , Rep. Lewis is the last of the big six leaders of the Civil Rights Movement still alive ( the others are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , James Farmer , A. Philip Randolph , Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young ) .Lewis was attacked by the KKK while participating in the Freedom Rides , buses of young activists that went to register black voters in segregated Alabama . The Klan deflated the tires of the bus he was on and forced it to stop . They attacked Lewis and the other riders , beating them for trying to accomplish their peaceful mission . Speaking about the attack years later , Lewis explained , It was very violent . I thought I was going to die . I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious . Lewis was also beaten by Alabama State Troopers on Bloody Sunday as civil rights marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma . His skull was fractured after he and others were hit with night sticks.For his role in the civil rights struggle , Rep.

Members of both parties asked the nominees , Chris Brummer , a Georgetown University law professor , and Brian Quintenz , an investment firm founder who once worked for a Republican Representative , about cooperation with other countries during the Agriculture Committee hearing . The committee will vote on the nominations in a separate business meeting . If approved , the nominations then go to the full Senate .

The European Commission announced this summer it was delaying its implementation of similar rules . Both Brummer and Quintenz spoke of the need to build strong relationships with other countries . But Brummer emphasized the U.S. role in leading rulemaking . “ Overall , I think that it ’ s hard ... to lead if you don ’ t lead by example . I think if you want to have a cross-border regulatory environment that is high quality then the United States should commit to the highest standards and find those who are like-minded , ” he said . Meanwhile , Quintenz worried firms could exploit timing gaps between different countries ’ rules implementation for financial gain , calling it “ regulatory arbitrage. ” “ Someone does have to go first but I don ’ t believe that ’ s the full analysis , ” he said . “ I believe the full analysis is : after you go first how long will it be until all the jurisdictions move and what is the size of the regulatory arbitrage you ’ re creating ?

       " 'Did you know that there are two words Muslims are not allowed to use ? Well , according to Christian conservatives , there are : the words God and greatest , especially together in a sentence as was demonstrated by Christians at a California Catholic church throwing themselves into a panic when a group of three Muslim gentlemen shouted Allahu Akbar ! That phrase , sometimes shouted by religious terrorists who speak Arabic , simply means God is the greatest . This or Jesus is Lord would be the exact thing shouted by some Christian extremists in America today . As an atheist , I personally find neither phrase alarming . Both Muslims and Christians , as well as Jews , worship the same god , and it doesn t matter in which language someone offers praise.That being said , these particular Muslim men shouted Allahu Akbar into an oh-so-dangerous megaphone exactly as Christian street preachers can be seen doing on a regular basis , just in a different language ( However , some Christian extremists simply show up at mosques with guns ) .The unidentified Muslims pulled up in front of St. Andrew Orthodox Church in Riverside , California , on public property , and shouted Allahu Akbar a few times before driving off . This was a completely harmless encounter with no weapons involved , and they were simply sharing the Christians message : God is the greatest . But Fox News reports they said the phrase maliciously , as though they do not praise the same god in their own religion . Nevertheless , these men are Muslim , so panic ensued . Via Fox News : Allahu Akbar ! the unidentified man repeated several times as the unnerved parents drew their infants close and exchanged worried glances.Witnesses were able to give Riverside police a description of the green Honda Civic , but not of the three occupants . Some told police they believed one or more of the men may have been taking photographs , according to Officer Ryan Railsback . Although Trenham insisted multiple congregants heard the Arabic phrase , Railsback noted no mention of it was in the police report.Whatever the case , no law was broken even if an unmistakable message was sent and received.This completely harmless incident that even Fox News had to admit was not a criminal act prompted the Christians to increase security and they want the Muslim men to repent for saying God is the greatest . Be calm and to keep a special vigilance over the property and our children while we are at church , Trenham wrote in an email to parishioners . Pray that these provocative young men might repent of their intimidation and be saved . He says that the situation the situation , once again , being that some Muslims said God is the greatest at a church is tense and tenuous and has vowed to keep new church security officers on hand for all regular services ( yes , those two words were so dangerous that they think they need security ) . It is a deep sorrow to live this way in the new America , Trenham told Fox.Jim Hoft , head honcho at Gateway Pundit and architect of the Michael Brown fractured Darren Wilson s eye socket lie and many others , decided to portray the incident as such : No , you re not suffering from anything and if you need your eyes checked it has nothing to do with this . He actually portrayed the phrase God is the greatest as a threat . Just to add to the drama , MUSLIMS is in ALLCAPS . Hoft s readers were more than happy to heap more hate on the manure pile : This was a brilliant move on the part of the Muslim men . all they had to do was repeat a common Christian message in Arabic , and the bigots quickly revealed themselves for who they are . Was it a bit immature ? Sure , but it was effective.Featured image via screengrab',\n",

       " '- U.S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to benefit President Donald Trump . Law enforcement agencies and congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with members of Trump ’ s campaign . Here is what is publicly known and not known : How did the investigations begin ? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election . Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017 . What did the intelligence agencies find ? The Central Intelligence Agency , the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome . The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House . Putin ’ s associates hacked information , paid social media “ trolls ” and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion , the agencies said . The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result . Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election . How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling ? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow ’ s role in the election , including possible collusion with Trump ’ s campaign . The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller , a former FBI director , as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe . Mueller would , if the evidence merits , work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions . In addition , there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling . What has Trump said about Russia ’ s role in the election ? He has not taken a clear public position . At a July 2016 news conference , Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clinton ’ s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying : “ I will tell you this , Russia : if you ’ re listening , I hope you ’ re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. ” He subsequently dismissed reports , including from U.S. intelligence officials , that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf . The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration . “ As far as hacking , I think it was Russia , ” Trump said , although he added : “ It could have been others also. ” Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election , offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials . Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed . “ The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax , when will this taxpayer funded charade end ? ” he wrote on Twitter on May 8 . On May 30 , Trump tweeted : “ Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News. ” Did the FBI probe continue after Comey ’ s dismissal ? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey ’ s departure . Andrew McCabe , who is leading the agency as acting director , promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey ’ s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it . Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray , who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal , to be the next FBI director . Wray will need Senate confirmation . Why was Comey fired ? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein , the deputy attorney general , on “ Restoring Confidence in the FBI ” that recommended Comey ’ s dismissal . Rosenstein ’ s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton ’ s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution . Rosenstein ’ s view was that Comey ’ s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general , Loretta Lynch . Trump called Comey a “ showboat ” and “ grandstander ” in an interview with NBC News on May 11 , saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein ’ s recommendation . Was Comey ’ s firing related to the FBI ’ s Russia probe ? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBI ’ s Russia probe . “ I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation , was in some way putting pressure on him , in some way irritating him , and he decided to fire me because of that , ” Comey said in his June 8 testimony . Trump asked Comey to end the agency ’ s investigation of Michael Flynn , his former national security adviser , and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear “ the cloud ” hanging over his presidency , according Comey ’ s testimony . Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agency ’ s probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation , in part because it would create a “ duty to correct ” if that changed . “ I need loyalty , I expect loyalty , ” Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner , according to Comey . Less than a week before he was fired , Comey told a congressional panel that it made him “ mildly nauseous ” that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election . In an unorthodox move , Great America Alliance , an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda , developed a television ad called “ Showboat ” to air as Comey testified . The ad claims Comey was “ consumed with election meddling ” at the expense of fighting terrorism . Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before , during or after the election campaign ? Flynn was fired in February . The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia ’ s ambassador to the United States , Sergei Kislyak , before Trump took office . On May 9 , federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen . On May 10 , the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation , demanding documents from Flynn . He provided the first batch on June 6 . Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016 . Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel . Is Trump himself under investigation ? Mueller ’ s probe has expanded to include examining whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to curtail the FBI ’ s probe of Russian meddling , the Washington Post reported on June 14 . In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI , he had thanked Comey for informing him that he was not under investigation . Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI . The Post reported the scope of the probe expanded to include Trump shortly after Comey ’ s dismissal , citing government officials . Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Marc Kasowitz , denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty .',\n",

DCIA Pompeo : WikiLeaks may think they are protecting those who provide them with classified information & other secrets , but they should not be certain of that. # RNDF CIA ( @ CIA ) December 3 , 2017RT International reports CIA Director Mike Pompeo said he won t tolerate secrets purloined by the CIA being stolen from the agency , and warned WikiLeaks to be more careful about protecting its sources.The CIA s official Twitter account tweeted Pompeo s comments about the whistleblowing site from an interview he gave at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday.Stealing Secrets I never miss an opportunity when I m with my officers to tell them the last thing we can tolerate is to have a secret that we ve stole re-stolen , Pompeo told moderator Brett Baier at the Los Angeles event.READ MORE : WikiLeaks publishes # Vault7 : Entire hacking capacity of the CIA It is simply unacceptable . It is our duty to protect them , he added . It is our duty to go after those who stole them , and to prosecute them within the bounds of the law in every way that we can . Mike Pompeo leads the Deep State crusade to destroy Assange and Wikileaks.Pompeo s comments come nine months after WikiLeaks began releasing Vault7 , a massive trove of classified CIA documents purportedly detailing the agency s hacking capabilities . The documents include reports of the agency s arsenal of malware and tech exploits , as well as its methods of infiltrating smartphones , TVs and laptops.The CIA is believed to have lost control of this arsenal before WikiLeaks obtained it . The hacking capabilities were doing the rounds among government hackers , one of whom provided WikiLeaks with the collection , the whistleblowing site explained . According to WikiLeaks , the Vault7 source wanted to initiate a public debate about the security , creation , use , proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons . Some of the biggest revelations in Vault7 were the CIA s ability to mask its hacking exploits to make them appear to be the work of other countries , namely Russia , China and Iran . It has raised questions about security firm Crowdstrike linking the Democratic National Committee email hack to Russian hackers.READ MORE : # Vault7 : WikiLeaks reveals Marble tool could mask CIA hacks with Russian , Chinese , ArabicWikileaks Sources I sometimes hear comments from WikiLeaks and Mr Assange thinking that those who have provided him classified information are safe and secure , Pompeo said .

Just to be clear , WikiLeaks is a national security threat in your eyes ? Baier asked Pompeo . Yes . You can go no further than the release of documents by [ Chelsea ] Manning to see the risk that it presents to the United States of America , the CIA chief responded.Pompeo was referring to US Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning , who released hundreds of thousands of documents from the military along with diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010.While the release revealed the extent of civilian casualties in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and included reports from Guantanamo Bay and the infamous Collateral Murder video depicting a US helicopter attack killing two employees and injuring two children , a 2011 Department of Defense report published in June found the disclosure had no significant effect on US interests.Pompeo has emerged as a staunch critic of WikiLeaks since becoming head of the CIA , describing the organization as a hostile intelligence agency , and dubbing Assange a narcissist and a fraud .

       " 'Great news ! A federal judge just ordered the State Department to make another attempt at locating Hillary Clinton s missing emails about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack . The interesting thing is that the judge is an Obama appointee who ruled with Judicial Watch . DIDN T DO ENOUGH .U.S . District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled Tuesday that the State Department did not do enough to track down messages Clinton may have sent about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound on Sept. 11 , 2012 an attack that killed four Americans , including the U.S. ambassador to Libya , Politico reported : In response to Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests , State searched the roughly 30,000 messages Clinton turned over to her former agency at its request in December 2014 after officials searching for Benghazi-related records realized she had used a personal email account during her four-year tenure as secretary.State later searched tens of thousands of emails handed over to the agency by three former top aides to Clinton : Huma Abedin , Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan . Finally , State searched a collection of emails the FBI assembled when it was investigating Clinton s use of the private account and server.In all , State found 348 Benghazi-related messages or documents that were sent to or from Clinton in a period of nearly five months after the attack.Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog group , said the State Department s initial search was not good enough because it didn t search the email accounts of Clinton s top aides for relevant messages pertaining to Benghazi.Mehta , an appointee of former President Barack Obama , agreed with Judicial Watch in a 10-page ruling . To date , State has searched only data compilations originating from outside sources Secretary Clinton , her former aides , and the FBI . It has not , however , searched the one records system over which it has always had control and that is almost certain to contain some responsive records : the state.gov e-mail server , Mehta wrote .',\n",
       " 'TASHKENT - Uzbek dissident writer Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon said on Monday that anti-government propaganda charges against him were a mistake and he hoped to be cleared by an impartial probe . Raufkhon , 62 , forced into exile after publishing a book critical of strongman leader Islam Karimov , last week became the first prominent dissident to return to the Central Asian nation since Karimov s death in September 2016 . Police detained Raufkhon on arrival on Sept. 27 from Turkey and said he had been charged with calling for an unconstitutional change of the state order and spreading materials threatening public security . He was led away from the airport in handcuffs and underwent questioning the same day . The authorities released him from jail on Sunday , but said the charges were still being investigated . The charges I face , spreading anti-government propaganda , I think it is a mistake , Raufkhon said in an interview with at his home . The idea raised in my book is about abiding by the constitution and I urged ( the authorities ) not to act against the constitution . I talked about mistakes in policies and tried to say what was wrong . Raufkhon said an impartial review of his book would show there is nothing against the state in it . I m hoping for the best , he said . Raufkhon decided to return to the former Soviet republic after Karimov s successor , President Shavkat Mirziyoyev ordered some 16,000 people , including the writer , struck off a security blacklist of potential extremists and dissidents in August . Mirziyoyev has also taken steps to liberalize other policies , moving to ease restrictions on travel and foreign exchange , as he seeks to improve ties with the West and attract foreign investment .',\n",
       " 'AUSTIN , Texas - A bill that would restrict access to public bathrooms by transgender people was approved by a Texas Senate committee on Wednesday after hundreds of people lined up for a nearly 21-hour session on that legislation , which critics said promotes discrimination . The bill would require people to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate , not the gender with which they identify . It will now go to the Republican-controlled Senate where it is expected to pass . Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick , who guides the Senate agenda , has said the legislation is a priority . Analysts do not expect the bill to make it through the state House of Representatives , where there is more concern about the potential economic impact of such legislation . The bill , which focuses on a heated political issue in the United States , is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina . That law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars . The Texas Association of Business released a study in January in which it said that if the legislation were enacted it could cost Texas as much as $ 8.5 billion in the state ’ s gross domestic product and the loss of more than 185,000 jobs in the first year alone . Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has challenged the survey and brought North Carolina Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest to Texas to rally support for the bill . Nearly 70 businesses , including some of the state ’ s biggest employers such as American Airlines , sent a letter to Republican leaders this month asking them to reject the bill on the grounds that it would “ legalize discrimination. ” THIRD-GRADER TESTIFIES Hundreds registered to testify , and more than 250 people addressed the committee . Some waited more than 12 hours while many bill opponents lined the corridors in the Capitol ’ s dome . “ At the core of this bill is privacy , ” Republican state Senator Lois Kolkhorst , the bill ’ s sponsor , told the committee . Almost all the testimony was against the bill while supporters said it would help prevent sexual predators from targeting women and children . Chelsa Morrison , whose 8-year-old daughter Marilyn started third grade at a suburban Dallas school after a gender transition , choked back tears as she told the committee that her daughter was bullied and if the legislation was enacted it would be devastating . Marilyn told lawmakers , “ Trans people are real . You are looking at one right now . This bill is horrifying to me and all of my transgender friends. ” She said it would be embarrassing if she were forced to use the boys ’ bathroom . “ All we got to do is tinkle and get out . That ’ s all. ” Her mother said later in a telephone interview that Marilyn attended school in the latter part of last year for about a month , then left because of bullying and bathroom restrictions . She is now being schooled at home . Lieutenant Governor Patrick has called the bill common sense legislation . “ North Carolina was the tip of the spear , ” he told reporters this week . “ We will be next to pass a bill that focuses on privacy , a person ’ s privacy , and public safety . ”',\n",
       " 'If Rubio isn t smart enough to see that Trump s catapult to the top of the GOP contenders happened the moment he took a strong stand against politicians putting illegal aliens before Americans , then is he really smart enough to run our nation ? And maybe even more importantly , if Rubio does recognize the majority of voters across the board want to elect a President who will stop the invasion of illegal aliens into our country , who is he planning to represent if he were to get the nomination ? Sen . [ score ] Marco Rubio [ /score ] ( R-FL ) is doubling down on his support for in-state tuition for illegal aliens.On ABC , George Stephanopoulos asked Rubio about his work in the Florida statehouse in which he co-sponsored legislation to provide in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants . Stephanopolous asked Rubio directly : Do you stand behind that position now ? Rubio said that he absolutely stands behind that legislation : RUBIO : It was a very narrowly drafted bill . You had to have a certain GPA , you had to live in the U.S. a long time , you had to graduate from a Florida high school . It was very narrowly tailored to high-performing students who found themselves in a situation where they were brought here by their parents when they were 5 , didn t even speak another language except English and therefore couldn t attend college because they were being charged like they were from out of state . They still had to pay for college but they paid for what people paid when they lived in Florida . They had to be high school graduates of Florida.STEPHANOPOULOS : So you stand behind that ? RUBIO : Yes , of a narrowly tailored bill like that , absolutely.In theory , this legislation means that an American student wishing to attend a Florida state university , who is from the neighboring state of Georgia , would have to pay higher tuition costs than an illegal immigrant from El Salvador , who has been living unlawfully in Florida and attending American public schools for the past thirteen years on the taxpayer dime . Illegal aliens are also eligible for generous child tax credits , a benefit protected in the Gang of Eight bill . Indeed , the taxes requirement in the Gang of Eight bill would have meant illegal aliens could receive tax payments in the form of free cash from the IRS , since poor illegal aliens have no tax liability.Rubio s plan to discount college tuition for illegal aliens will serve as a further magnet to new illegal immigration , and will also increase competition for college slots and post-college jobs for American youth who are already struggling . Moreover , due to affirmative action policies , these illegal aliens will not have their tuition discounted but their applications given preferential treatment as well.By contrast , front-runner Donald Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd that same day that he opposes Rubio s legislation to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded tuition discounts.TODD : Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida ( back when he was in the State House ) to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants . There s a lot of states that allow in-state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants . I ve not heard your position on that.TRUMP : I m opposed to it.TODD : Totally opposed ? TRUMP : They re here . They re not here legally . I m opposed to itTODD : Even kids born to illegal immigrants ? It is perhaps interesting to note that Chuck Todd seems a bit confused about U.S. immigration policy illegal alien tuition discounts are for foreign-born youth who are themselves illegal immigrants . Under current policy , the US-born children are automatic birthright citizens , meaning no legislation is required to make them eligible for all the benefits enjoyed by Americans . Indeed , illegal immigrants primarily access welfare programs through their U.S.-born children . As a September 2015 report from the Center for Immigration Studies noted , analysis shows that legal immigrant households make extensive use of most welfare programs , while illegal immigrant households primarily benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children . Regardless , Trump made clear in the interview he would ensure that neither illegal alien youth ( DREAMers ) or birthright citizenship children , would be eligible for such benefits . Trump made clear he would move to eliminate birthright citizenship so that the US-born children of illegal aliens would no longer made automatic citizens . Again , by contrast , Rubio supports birthright citizenship a position which is supported by only 20 % of Republicans according to the most recent Rasmussen Reports immigration survey issued on December 27 , 2015.Rubio s Sunday endorsement of discount college tuition for the foreign-born illegal alien youth is in keeping with his longstanding support for DREAM amnesty proposals , which have been a passion of Gang of Eight co-member [ score ] Dick Durbin [ /score ] .While Rubio briefly distanced himself of his support for DREAMer amnesty in 2010 in order to get elected to the U.S. Senate and indeed attacked attacked his opponent [ score ] Charlie Crist [ /score ] specifically for his support of the DREAM Act upon arriving in the U.S. Senate , Rubio quickly used his new position of power to begin working on a plan to legalize so-called DREAMers . In 2012 , Rubio wrote : They re not in compliance with immigration law , and , thus , not American citizens . But they are culturally as American as anyone else s children Rubio s statement might be news to Laura Wilkerson whose 18-year-old son , Joshua , was gruesomely murdered by his DREAMer classmate . In her Congressional testimony last summer , Wilkerson told lawmakers how her son was , beaten , strangled , tortured until he died . He was tied up , thrown in a field , and set on fire [ During his trial ] , we had to hear this kid on the stand muttering about , In my country In my country never to finish that sentence . We listened to him tell us repeatedly that his killing skills took over . Wilkerson told lawmakers , You can not you can not stand by and ignore our families our American families . You re elected by Americans , not any other country . You should be for Americans . Yet Rubio remains so committed to amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly entered as minors that he has said he will not immediately revoke President Obama s lawless 2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers . In a Spanish-language interview with Jorge Ramos , Rubio said : Well , DACA is going to have to end at some point . I wouldn t undo it immediately . The reason is that there are already people who have that permission , who are working , who are studying , and I don t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly . But I do think it is going to have to end . And , God willing , it s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass . Rejected-Majority Leader [ score ] Eric Cantor [ /score ] similarly supported Rubio s efforts to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants . Cantor declared , One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents . This prompted Cantor s then-primary challenger Rep. [ score ] Dave Brat [ /score ] ( R-VA ) to describe Cantor s declaration as one of the most radical pro-amnesty statements ever delivered by a sitting representative . Brat wrote , In what was billed as a new agenda for the Republican Party , Cantor declared that citizenship for illegals was required by the great founding principles of our country . With this remark , Cantor declared his support not only for amnesty now , but amnesty forever . Ken Palinkas , the former head of the nation s immigration caseworkers Citizenship and Immigration Services has similarly explained how the DREAM Act would represents a promise of perpetual amnesty : If it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens , then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently ? Indeed , government reports have documented how the 2014 illegal alien minor surge on our southern border was caused , in large part , by the promise of amnesty for alien youth.As Senator [ score ] Jeff Session [ /score ] has written , It can not be the policy of the United States that any of the 2 billion people in the world who have yet turn to turn 18 have a right to illegally enter the United States and claim residency . Polling data suggests that in the event Rubio s position on this controversial DREAMer amnesty begins to receive large-scale media coverage something that has not happened yet it could pose problems for him in New Hamspshire , where he is currently in second place . As The Hill reported in 2014 , More people in New England oppose illegal immigration compared to the rest of the country Nearly 80 percent of people in that region said illegal immigrants threaten U.S. beliefs and customs , according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.New Hampshire also voted for Pat Buchanan in 1996 who , like Trump , is opposed to both the cheaper foreign labor and cheap foreign imports Senator Rubio has sought to import.Via : Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'Washington Post : Is this the woman that Michelle Obama sees when she looks in the mirror now , free of the White House and the media scrutiny of presidential politics ? After more than a decade in public life , can she freely shed the sheath dress and pearls for a wide brim black hat and dookie braids ? She just did.By allowing herself to be photographed alongside 15 other members of Beyonc s inner circle , Obama reclaimed her image from the annals of stodgy first lady portraits . And , she did it by embodying Beyonc s.The image , in case you haven t seen it , is part of a birthday tribute to the singer who posted portraits of black women some famous , others not dressed in one of her iconic looks from the Formation video.For those who aren t able to pick out Michelle without seeing her perpetual scowl or eyeballs rolling , she s the one in the middle : The Washington Post took great pains to make sure there is no room for interpretation when it comes the reason Michelle Obama chose to publicly throw her support behind Beyonce s divisive , cop-hating music.From the Washington Post : Both the former first lady and Queen Bey are two women who don t put images out into the world without carefully considering their meaning . So what s the former first lady telling us with this one ? First , that she loves Beyonc . Well , duh : Their track record of public support dates back to the first inauguration , when the singer serenaded the Obamas with Etta James s At Last . Second , that she loved Formation , undeniably one of Beyonc s most overtly political tracks . The video featured stark images of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , along with graffiti supporting the movement for Black Lives Matter , a police cruiser sinking into a body of water and a young black boy dancing in front of a line of officers outfitted in riot gear . That s all before Beyonc throws up her middle fingers.In other words There can be no denying that Michelle has given up the front , and is coming out as a full-fledged supporter of the anti-law enforcement Black Lives Matter domestic terror group.The Washington Post wrapped up their piece by reminding their readers how painful it s been for Michelle to be stuck in the White House , and how she s looking forward to living a normal life again , unlike the stodgy former first ladies before her : In one of her final interviews as first lady , Obama told Oprah Winfrey that she longed for a normal life after living in the nation s fish bowl . So it seems counter intuitive for her to participate in this such a public display of adulation for one of the world s most famous women.Add to that the controversial nature of the look which hearkens to Beyonc in one of her more militant moments . Remember that satirical New Yorker cover , which cast Michelle Obama as a fist-bumping , combat boot-wearing , afro d commando ? That image , Obama has said , knocked [ her ] back .',\n",
       " \"I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton . Rep. Gaetz : `` I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton . '' # IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EHkQfyeWDK Fox News ( @ FoxNews ) November 22 , 2017Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Goetz is calling for an investigation into why Hillary Clinton s FBI case was labelled special by the FBI s Andrew McCabe : The Hill reports : Shortly before last year s election , FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the Hillary Clinton email probe had been given special status , according to documents released Wednesday.McCabe s Oct. 23 , 2016 , email to press officials in the FBI said the probe was under the control of a small group of high-ranking people at the FBI s headquarters in Washington . As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team , McCabe wrote in the email . He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015 , while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office . [ The Washington office ] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a special and I was not given any details about it , he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a special or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began . We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released , bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a special status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an incident and not an investigation . It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton . Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else ?\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Democratic Senator Ron Wyden thinks Republican leadership is moving away from trying to implement full-scale tax reform this year and instead are turning their attention to simply cutting rates . “ If you look at the language of Mitch McConnell in the last couple of days , he ’ s talking about tax cuts , he ’ s been saying , ‘ Well , I don ’ t know about tax reform , let ’ s have a tax cut , ’ ” Wyden , the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , said in an interview with on Friday . “ To me that would really be , again , contrary to what the president campaigned on , ” he said . McConnell is the Senate majority leader . Sweeping tax reform had been high on the Republican legislative agenda . But so far , House of Representatives and the Senate , both controlled by Republicans , have been unable to find consensus on a tax package that could pass both chambers and be signed into law by President Donald Trump . Wyden argued there is robust bipartisan agreement that a tax overhaul is needed . “ There are plenty of Republicans in Congress - because they talk to me - who would really like to do major tax reform , ” he said . Last month , the White House weighed in on the tax discussion , offering only a one-page plan that included deep cuts in rates , many for businesses , but stopped well short of legislative language or providing detail on specific changes . “ The tax reform proposal is shorter than drug store receipts I have , ” Wyden remarked . Several lawmakers have warned that if tax reform is not completed by the end of 2017 , it will become more difficult to pass in 2018 , when Congressional midterm elections will be held . The House has begun holding hearings and has developed a “ blue print ” - including a controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports while providing credit for exports . Wyden , in an echo of other senators , including Republicans , said that a border adjustment tax would be unlikely to fare well in the Senate - going so far to call it a “ grocery tax ” that would unfairly hit consumers in the middle class .',\n",
       " 'MILWAUKEE - Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tussling in Wisconsin over who would best represent the Democratic Party against Republican front-runner Donald Trump . The competition was in full force on Saturday night at the Wisconsin Democratic Party ’ s “ Founders Day Gala , ” a chance for both Cliinton and Sanders to make their closing arguments before the state ’ s primary vote on Tuesday . Clinton , as the Democratic front-runner , is more and more taking aim at both Trump and U.S . Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , the top Trump rival who is leading Wisconsin polls of Republican voters . Trump , in response to the threat of Islamic militants , has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and Cruz has called for police patrols of Muslim neighborhoods . Clinton said these ideas are offensive . “ That does not make Trump and Cruz sound strong , ” said Clinton to the crowd of 1,400 . “ It makes them sound in over their heads ... You know loose cannons tend to misfire , and in a dangerous world that is a gamble we can not afford. ” Sanders , a U.S. senator from Vermont who has been a surprisingly strong challenger to Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination , told the crowd he would be a better opponent against Trump than Clinton . Sanders noted national poll numbers showing he leads Trump by a larger margin than Clinton leads the New York billionaire . Sanders said this makes him “ the strongest candidate ” on the Democratic side to go up against Trump . “ It ’ s not just polling , ” Sanders said . “ There is one campaign which has created an enormous amount of excitement and enthusiasm and that is our campaign. ” For the Democratic Party to succeed in the Nov. 8 election , Sanders said , “ we need a vibrancy ” and energy that brings in young people who have flocked to his campaign .',\n",
       " 'MADRID/BARCELONA - Spanish police raided Catalan government offices and arrested officials on Wednesday to halt a banned referendum on independence , an action the regional president said meant Madrid had effectively taken over his administration . Tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside the regional government offices in the center of Barcelona s tourist district as well as in several Catalan cities , waving the red-and-yellow Catalan flag and chanting Occupying forces out and Where is Europe ? . The Spanish state has by all rights intervened in Catalonia s government and has established emergency rule , Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said in a televised address . We condemn and reject the anti-democratic and totalitarian actions of the Spanish state , he said , adding Catalans should turn out in force to vote in the Oct. 1 referendum on a split from Spain that Madrid has declared illegal . State police arrested Catalonia s junior economy minister Josep Maria Jove on Wednesday in their first raid of government offices in the region , Catalan government sources said . The raid targeted several regional government departments . A dozen high-ranking local officials were arrested , La Vanguardia newspaper said . Police confirmed they were carrying out raids connected with the banned referendum , but did not give details . The Catalan government sources could not confirm the other arrests . In several Barcelona districts , people banged on balconies railings and dumpsters while passing cars hooted noisily . Among the protesters outside the government office in Barcelona , was Carlos , a 47-year-old taxi driver . We re here so they know they can t do whatever they want , he said , as protesters bore banners reading Democracy and Vote to be free . The FC Barcelona soccer club said in a statement : FC Barcelona , in remaining faithful to its historic commitment to the defense of the nation , to democracy , to freedom of speech , and to self-determination , condemns any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights . Police efforts to stop the referendum have intensified in recent days as the wealthy northeastern region shows no signs of halting it . Acting under court orders , police have raided printers , newspaper offices and private delivery companies in a search for campaign literature , instruction manuals for manning voting stations and ballot boxes . The Civil Guard , a national police force , on Wednesday seized 10 million ballot papers , polling station displays as well as documents and forms to run the vote , including a list of voters under the headline 2017 Catalonia self-determination referendum . ( For a graphic on Catalonia secession click tmsnrt.rs/2xw6JtO ) It had on Tuesday seized more than 45,000 envelopes packed in cardboard boxes that the Catalan government was ready to send to notify people about the referendum , while the first of hundreds of Catalan mayors appeared before the state prosecutor after they said they would back the referendum . Spain s finance ministry has taken over the region s finances to prevent the use of public money to organize the vote . But the central government must tread a fine line in enforcing the law in the region without seeming heavy-handed . Polls show a minority of Catalans , albeit more than 40 percent , support independence although a majority want a referendum on the issue . Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Wednesday the operations in Catalonia were the result of legal rulings and were to ensure the rule of law . He later called on Catalan leaders to cancel the vote . Don t go ahead , you don t have any legitimacy to do it . Go back to the law and democracy ( ... ) This referendum is a chimera , he said in a televised speech . Any action that broke the law would be met with a proportionate response , he added . The Constitutional Court has suspended the vote after the central government challenged its legality . Spain s central government says the referendum goes against the 1978 constitution which states Spain is indivisible . Under Article 155 of the constitution , Madrid has the power to suspend the regional government s authority to rule . It has yet to exercise this option as it seeks to block the vote through the courts . Although markets have so far shrugged off the increasing tension , Spain s top stock index underperformed regional European stock peers on Wednesday . The IBEX fell more than 1 percent by late afternoon trading with financials the biggest drags . Euro zone stocks were off about 0.2 percent .',\n",
       " 'Funny how this just keeps happening.Yet another Trump advisor has been caught having ties to a shady , fascist-linked group in Europe . No it wasn t Trump s former campaign manager who had ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists . Or his former National Security Advisor who was secretly working on behalf of the Turkey during Trump s campaign . Or his former advisor who has ties to both Russia and the hacker responsible for stealing the DNC s emails.This time it is Sebastian Gorka , a top national security advisor who was just outed as being a member of a Nazi-allied Hungarian group . Oh , and he also violated immigration laws when he moved to the United States and didn t mention that he was , in fact , a friend of Nazis . ( Being a friend of Nazis is sort of something the American government frowns upon at least it was until January 20th of this year . ) Gorka was first outed by The Forward and things quickly came tumbling down.The elite order , known as the Vit zi Rend , was established as a loyalist group by Admiral Miklos Horthy , who ruled Hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to October 1944 . A self-confessed anti-Semite , Horthy imposed restrictive Jewish laws prior to World War II and collaborated with Hitler during the conflict . His cooperation with the Nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands.Gorka s membership in the organization if these Vit zi Rend leaders are correct , and if Gorka did not disclose this when he entered the United States as an immigrant could have implications for his immigration status . The State Department s Foreign Affairs Manual specifies that members of the Vit zi Rend are presumed to be inadmissible to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act.First he stonewalled when asked about his ties to the Nazi-allied group . Then the leaders of Vit zi Rend verified that he was a member of their organization which included taking what they call a lifelong oath of loyalty to their group . And finally Gorka refused to confirm or deny that he was a member of the group . As many have noted , being asked Are you a member of a pro-Nazi group ? shouldn t be hard to answer . For most people it would be easy to say no or more colorfully Are you crazy ? Of course not ! Gorka instead told reporters to send a request to White House press . Sean Spicer is about to have a really bad day.The stonewalling by Gorka comes at a time when the Trump administration is already having trouble condemning anti-Semitism . Trump s pathetic lack of moral fiber when it comes to intolerance coupled with the revelation that one of his closest advisors is a member of a group that handed hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands prompted the Anne Frank Center to once again condemn the Trump administration.Steven Goldstein , executive director of the @ AnneFrankCenter gave this statement : pic.twitter.com/Xczmq0uX0k Talal Ansari ( @ TalalNAnsari ) March 16 , 2017At what point do all these dots finally become connected ?

Trump s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day , according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan , breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.The mandate issued without exceptions , according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23 , diplomats who saw it said threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany , Canada and Britain . In the past , administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow a handful of ambassadors , particularly those with school-age children , to remain in place for weeks or months.Mr . Trump , by contrast , has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements . Political ambassadors , many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president , almost always leave at the end of his term ; ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts.A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move , describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule , just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do . The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations , said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date . NYT s',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump will seek quick progress toward a bilateral trade agreement with Japan in place of a broader Asia-Pacific deal he abandoned this week , when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits the White House next month , an official in the Trump administration said on Thursday . “ I see Abe ’ s visit being more about finding a follow-through , a replacement for TPP , ” said the official , referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump ditched on Monday . “ Given the domestic political capital ( Abe has ) expended on TPP , there ’ s going to be an effort to work with him on a follow-on , ” the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . Trump , who took office last Friday , reiterated on Thursday he would strike numerous bilateral deals , as opposed to multilateral accords like the TPP . He said they would include clauses to allow a 30-day termination notice if the United States was not treated fairly . The TPP , which took years to negotiate among 12 countries , has often been described as being , at its core , a deal between the United States and Japan , the world ’ s largest and third-largest economies respectively . Trump called it bad for American jobs , but proponents worry that abandoning the project could further strengthen China ’ s economic hand in the region . Japanese media have said Abe is expected to meet Trump in Washington on Feb. 10 , although no official announcement has been made as to the timing of the trip . The administration official said it “ was clear what the outlines and the contours ” of a deal with Japan would be , but did not go into details . “ I don ’ t know if there needs to be this protracted long-term negotiation , and there may be some initial steps that are implemented prior to an official Free Trade Agreement , ” he said . “ It ’ s pretty clear what the problems are on the trade side and it ’ s pretty clear what the opportunities are . I don ’ t think it ’ ll be particularly difficult to get some movement on a couple of different aspects of the trade side relatively quickly. ” The White House declined comment on the official ’ s remarks . “ We look forward to Prime Minister Abe ’ s upcoming visit and a productive relationship with Japan , ” a White House official said . Abe has touted TPP as an engine of economic reform and a counterweight to a rising China but said on Thursday it was possible Tokyo and Washington could hold bilateral free trade talks . “ Japan will continue to stress to the U.S. the importance of the TPP but it is not totally unfeasible for talks on EPA ( Economic Partnership Agreement ) and FTA ( Free Trade Agreement ) ” with the United States , Abe told parliament after being asked about trade talks between the two nations . Japan ’ s Kyodo news agency said Abe also suggested Japan would advocate retaining some form of tariffs on rice and four other key agricultural products in any trade negotiations with the United States . “ We will thoroughly protect what we should protect ... I want to carry out bilateral negotiations properly , based on the thinking that agriculture is the foundation of this country , ” it quoted him as saying .',\n",

About 60 percent come from East African nations such as Somalia and Ethiopia , and 25 percent from West African nations such as Nigeria and Liberia . The rest come from elsewhere in Africa.Of more than 85,700 Somalis officially known to reside in the U.S. , nearly a third are thought to reside in Minnesota.Corrie , a professor at Concordia University in St. Paul , believes the state s African population produces $ 14 million in philanthropy within Minnesota each year , on top of $ 150 million in annual remittances to countries in Africa.I don t know why this is considered a good thing sending money out of America that will never benefit our economy ! Some of the smart people on our side should get to work doing studies that will show the real picture including how much welfare is consumed by the immigrants , how costly is their medical care and education , the cost to the criminal justice system , and include an analysis of where the money goes !

Last month The Hill published the Senator s criticism of America s largest non-nuclear bomb being dropped in Afghanistan , the White House quickly scrambled with a rebuttal an unusually high level of concern over one senator . As somebody who is probably , in the hearts and minds of liberal activists , a leader of the party , that voice carries some weight , and we have to respond , said a White House official who wishes to remain anonymous.In an effort to put down the Senator , Trump brought back his favorite and most offensive Warren insults last month , referring to her as Pocahontas while delivering a speech to the National Rifle Associate . I have a feeling that in the next election , you re going to be swamped with candidates , said Trump . It may be Pocahontas , remember that . Many see Warren as a likely 2020 presidential candidate , and when Trump can t find legitimated faults with his adversaries , he cowardly resorts to racial insults as attempts to make them look bad . Warren has abstained from engaging in name calling , despite what the Trump administration has to say about her .

       " 'The black residents of Dothan , Alabama are , quite literally , living in fear and with good reason . Their police chief , Steven Parrish , is an open member of a neo- Confederate organization by the name of the Sons of Confederate Veterans . Even worse is the fact that officials in Dothan are fully behind Parrish keeping his job as police chief , despite his ties to a clearly racist organization.During a Tuesday government meeting , Dothan Mayor Schmitz allowed just one person in support of Parrish and one against him to speak . Paul Carroll , one of Dothan s black residents , said to the meeting : This would never happen to the Jewish community . You would never see someone who s a neo-Nazi being made chief of police , but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo-Confederate ? Carroll also said to local paper the Dothan Eagle : We are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections ? I don t ( feel safe ) . Sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority . And Carroll has good reason to feel that way , as Parrish openly says he is a Sons of Confederate Veterans Commander . So , it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization , but he has to be a commander . It is also believed ( but not proven ) that Parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force.Another of the city s black residents , Ruth Nelson , says of Parrish s reign as chief : This is a nightmare . And when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this .. they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth . Resident Kevin Saffold alluded to the idea that the city of Dothan would soon be in an uproar if the Parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction : If you don t want this to be another Ferguson , if you don t want civil unrest , if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative , then you should do something about that . I believe in the court system and I believe in justice I don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field . All of these residents are right , and they have every right to be outraged and afraid . After all , there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist POS.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON/MOSCOW - U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Korea s weapons program as a failure on Thursday , while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot , but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang . In a tweet , Trump delivered another insulting barb against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , who he called Little Rocket Man and a sick puppy after North Korea test-fired its most advanced missile to date on Wednesday . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington s approach was dangerously provocative . Trump s tweets further inflamed tensions reignited this week after North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in a breakthrough that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons whose warheads could withstand re-entry to the Earth s atmosphere . The Chinese envoy , who just returned from North Korea , seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man , Trump said on Twitter , a day after speaking with Chinese President Chinese President Xi Jinping and reiterating his call for Beijing to use its leverage against North Korea . Tillerson on Thursday welcomed Chinese efforts on North Korea , but said Beijing could do more to limit its oil exports to the country . The Chinese are doing a lot . We do think they could do more with the oil . We re really asking them to please restrain more of the oil , not cut it off completely , Tillerson said at the State Department . China is North Korea s neighbor and its sole major trading partner . While Trump has been bellicose at times in rhetoric toward North Korea , Tillerson has persistently held out hopes for a return to dialogue if North Korea shows it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons program . However , Tillerson may not remain in his job long , with disagreements with Trump over North Korea being one factor . On Thursday , senior Trump administration officials said the White House was considering a plan to replace Tillerson with Mike Pompeo , the director of the Central Intelligence Agency . U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he still had confidence in diplomatic efforts on North Korea and that the United States would be unrelenting in working through the United Nations . In spite of Trump s rhetoric and warnings that all options , including military ones , are on the table in dealing with North Korea , his administration has stressed it favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis . Trump has pledged more sanctions in response to the latest test and , at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting late Wednesday , the United States warned North Korea s leadership would be utterly destroyed if war were to break out . This administration is focused on one big thing when it comes to North Korea , and that s denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a regular White House briefing . Anything beyond that is not the priority at this point , she said , responding to a question on whether regime change was on the administration s agenda after Trump s recent tweets and a speech by U.N . Ambassador Nikki Haley . Lavrov pointed to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises planned for December and accused the United States of trying to provoke Kim into flying off the handle over his missile program to hand Washington a pretext to destroy his country . He also flatly rejected a U.S. call for Russia to cut ties with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile program , calling U.S. policy toward North Korea deeply flawed . In a call with Trump on Thursday , South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the missile launched this week was North Korea s most advanced so far , but it was unclear whether Pyongyang had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and it still needed to prove other things , such as its re-entry technology . A White House statement said Trump and Moon reiterated their strong commitment to enhancing the deterrence and defense capabilities of the U.S.-South Korea alliance and added : Both leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to compelling North Korea to return to the path of denuclearization at any cost . North Korea has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under Kim s leadership and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in September . It has said its weapons programs are a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade . The United States , which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War , denies any such intention . Previous U.S. administrations have failed to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and a sophisticated missile program . Trump , who has previously said the United States would totally destroy North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from the nuclear threat , has also struggled to contain Pyongyang since taking office in January .',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - Three Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the president of Kushner Companies on Thursday seeking information related to concerns that the real estate firm has exploited Jared Kushner ’ s role as a White House adviser to attract investment through a federal immigration program . Jared Kushner , the son-in-law of President Donald Trump and one of his top advisers , early this year stepped down as chief executive officer of his family ’ s real estate company . Senator Patrick Leahy and Representatives John Conyers and Zoe Lofgren , in the nine-page letter dated Thursday and sent to Kushner Companies President Laurent Morali , asked for details about the company ’ s controversial May road show in China , where the developer offered investors a chance to get U.S. visas under the EB-5 program if they put money in a project in New Jersey , One Journal Square . The letter , which was released publicly , also asked Kushner Companies what steps it has taken to ensure its affiliates do not exploit Jared Kushner ’ s White House role when wooing investors in the future . The lawmakers cited a May 12 report that a Chinese immigration agency promoting the Kushner Companies project had touted Kushner ’ s White House connections to assure potential investors that the One Journal Square project would succeed and investors would receive green cards . Such guarantees are prohibited by the rules of the EB-5 program , which grants foreigners a U.S. green card in exchange for investing $ 500,000 or more in development projects in low-employment areas of the United States . Kushner Companies did not immediately return calls for comment . Kushner Companies had apologized for Nicole Kushner Meyer ’ s reference to her brother , Jared Kushner , when pitching One Journal Square in China in May . The letter by the three Democrats follows a call by the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Chuck Grassley , last week for a probe into “ potentially fraudulent statements and misrepresentations ” made by companies promoting investment in the One Journal Square project . Leahy , Conyers , and Lofgren - all members of the House or Senate Judiciary Committees - noted in their letter that they have worked with Republican committee members since 2015 to improve the EB-5 program by enacting tougher anti-fraud measures . Jared Kushner used to be closely involved with groups that lobbied against those reform efforts , according to the letter , including one firm that is marketing the One Journal Square project . The Democratic lawmakers ’ letter asked if Kushner Companies had engaged in any lobbying related to EB-5 program reforms or discussed the program with Kushner since Trump took office in January .',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS - NATO has joined world powers diplomatic efforts to stop North Korea s missile program but it can not yet rely on its U.S.-built shield to defend Europe , experts and diplomats said . The United States says the shield , more than a decade in the planning , is needed to protect against so-called rogue states , a term U.S. officials have used to refer to North Korea and Iran . But with Berlin , Paris and London potentially within striking distance of North Korea s missiles from next year , officials say the U.S.-led alliance s system needs more radars and special interceptors to destroy a rocket from Pyongyang . The NATO shield in its current state lacks the reach and early warning radars to shoot down North Korean rockets . It s a weak link , said Michael Elleman , a missile defense analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) . Early tracking is also difficult because North Korean missiles would be flying over Russia , where NATO obviously can not put radars , he added . The sort of interceptor needed to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles could breach a Soviet-era arms control agreement between the United States and Russia because of its greater range , arms experts say . Moscow has long objected to U.S. missile shield plans , saying their real aim is to neutralize Russia s own nuclear arsenal , rather than meet the perceived threat from rogue states . Russia s strategic concerns would , therefore , make it hard to renegotiate the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) treaty , something arms experts say would be required if a North Korean missile shield were to be fully effective . Alliance planning to confront any threat from Pyongyang is in its infancy . Following North Korea s country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 , two senior NATO diplomats told that protection against the North Korean threat was only beginning to be considered at NATO headquarters in Brussels . That was despite a more forceful diplomatic tone on the crisis and warnings on the scale and immediacy of the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump s new ambassador to NATO , France s defense minister and the alliance s deputy head . While analysts do not expect North Korea to have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile until next year at the earliest , NATO s European allies could become a target as a way of threatening their closest partner , the United States , a third NATO diplomat said , stressing that was only speculation . The United States switched on its $ 800 million European missile defense umbrella in May last year at a site in Romania to protect against Iranian rockets . The system , controlled from a NATO base in Germany , includes radars and interceptors stretching from eastern Europe to the Mediterranean . A final site in Poland should be ready by late 2018 , extending the European umbrella from Greenland and the Azores . To shoot down a ballistic missile from North Korea would require a new generation of interceptor , the Block II , which is still in development . It is capable of downing ballistic rockets earlier and at a much higher altitude . However , Elleman said that U.S. missile sites in Alaska and California , as well as in Japan and South Korea , were likely to be given priority before Europe , when they are ready in 2018 . There will be a lot of competition for the assets , he said .',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI - A Hindu man in India tried to raise money for a campaign against minority Muslims by issuing an appeal for donations with a video he took and posted online showing him killing a Muslim , police said on Thursday . The killing last week is the latest to roil India s minority Muslims who have faced attacks from mobs who accuse them of killing cows , which Hindus consider sacred . Hindu fringe groups also campaign against Muslim men marrying Hindus . The Hindu man , Shambu Lal Regar , has been arrested on suspicion of hacking and burning a Muslim laborer in the western state of Rajasthan , police said . Regar had posted a video of the attack along with his bank details for donations to finance his anti-Muslim campaign , police officer Anand Shrivastava said . More than 700 people from across India deposited 300,000 rupees ( $ 4,665 ) into the account . The accused wanted to become a Hindu hero after killing a Muslim man , his main aim was to collect money after committing the hate crime , said Shrivastava . Regar s video went viral on social media before authorities took it down . Police investigators had frozen the bank account and were tracking down donors , Shrivastava said . Shrivastava said the video had showed Regar claiming to be a proud Hindu trying to stop love jihad - a term used by Hindu hardliners who accuse Muslim men of entrapping Hindu women and girls on the pretext of love in order to convert them to Islam . The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who leads the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop attacks on Muslims . The government rejects that . Modi has condemned violence in the name of protecting cows . Muslims account for 172 million of India s 1.32 billion citizens and Modi s critics say Hindu groups linked with his ruling party are trying to marginalize them . The BJP denies any bias against Muslims',\n",
       " 'Whether federal spending legislation crosses the line from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine , and courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear . In this case , however , there can be no doubt . Justices Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas , and AlitoJustice Anthony Kennedy was furious when a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama s healthcare law . As he read the dissenting opinion from the bench three years ago , his anger was palpable . The majority regards its opinion as judicial modesty , he declared . It is not . It amounts instead to a vast judicial over-reaching . That was Kennedy on June 28 , 2012.Now , as the country awaits a ruling in the second major challenge to Obama s signature Affordable Care Act , a question is whether the justice who was the voice of the opposition then could provide the critical fifth vote to uphold the law on the nine-justice court now.At stake are the tax-credit subsidies that have helped low- and moderate-income Americans obtain health insurance . The challengers say the government unlawfully extended those subsidies to states that did not create local insurance exchanges but instead relied on the federal exchange . If the court strikes down the subsidies , millions of Americans in at least 34 of the 50 states could lose coverage.Five years after its passage , the Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in American life even as it remains politically divisive . This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another , Obama , a Democrat , declared in a speech last week . Republicans have called for repeal and among the related lawsuits simmering in lower courts is a dispute brought by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives over Treasury Department payments to healthcare insurers.IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICTIn the case before the court , the unique issue along with Kennedy s record and his comments in oral arguments raise the possibility he will join the four liberal justices to endorse the law . Three years ago , his fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts cast the swing vote with the liberals to uphold the law . It marked a rare episode when Kennedy , the usual key justice on this divided bench , did not control the outcome of a momentous case.It is impossible to predict with confidence how the court will resolve the case , King v. Burwell . A ruling is anxiously awaited by officials in Washington and the insurance and healthcare industries nationwide.What is known : Two days after the March 4 oral arguments this year , the justices , per their usual practice , took a vote in a small conference room off Chief Justice Roberts chambers . The most senior justice on the winning side then assigned the opinion for those in the majority ; the senior justice on the dissenting side tapped a writer for the main dissent . Drafts of dueling opinions began circulating among the chambers.In this conversation through memos , the justices will sharpen their arguments , sometimes compromising in reasoning and rhetoric to keep a majority together . Those in dissent similarly hone their retorts . The process is shrouded in secrecy , and the public will only know who is writing which opinion when they are issued.For King v. Burwell , the decision could come down as soon as Monday morning , when the justices next take the bench . It is more likely to be issued later this month . The toughest disputes tend to be resolved right up against the traditional end-of-June deadline for the court s nine-month session . Among the 20 awaited cases is also the question of whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage.A PIVOTAL POSITIONOn healthcare , either Kennedy or Roberts could tip the balance . Yet the 78-year-old Kennedy , appointed to the bench in 1988 by Republican President Ronald Reagan , may be in a more pivotal position based on his respect for state sovereignty and concern for the practical consequences of a decision.While the 2012 dispute posed a broad-ranging constitutional challenge to the individual insurance mandate before it even took effect , this one turns on a mere four-word clause allowing tax credits for insurance purchased through exchanges established by the state . The challengers , libertarian lawyers who were among those who lodged the 2012 attack , say that means that the subsidies are not available to people who have bought insurance through federally facilitated exchanges , which vastly outnumber state-run exchanges . The Obama administration contends the law , taken as a whole , makes clear that Congress , when it passed the law , intended the subsidies to apply to all exchanges.During oral arguments Justice Kennedy suggested the challengers view of the law could put unconstitutional federal pressure on states , because if they failed to set up exchanges , they would lose subsidies : The states are being told either create your own exchange or we ll send your insurance market into a death spiral , he said.Kennedy also does not rigidly interpret the words of a statute . He considers how a decision may play out , and he noted that if people pay mandated taxes and are denied tax credits , the cost of insurance will be sky-high . Still , Kennedy may harbor skepticism about the law known as Obamacare , and he acknowledged during arguments the possibility that the challengers could prevail on the plain words of the statute .

       " 'NEW YORK - Some rabbis and Jewish students are planning protests against Donald Trump ’ s speech on Monday at a conference of the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC over what they say are his belittling comments about Muslims and other groups . About 18,000 people are expected to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ’ s three-day annual conference in Washington . It is not clear how many will either boycott or walk out of the Republican presidential front-runner ’ s address . “ He has taken every opportunity to vilify women , Muslims , Mexicans , immigrants and the disabled , ” said Jeffrey Salkin , a rabbi in Hollywood , Florida , who asked rabbis across the country to join him in a boycott . He said 40 had agreed and signed a protest letter he hoped to distribute at the conference . Another group of rabbis and students called Come Together Against Hate is planning to walk out of the room after Trump takes the stage . Jesse Olitzky , one of its organizers , said he did not know how many people would participate . The group ’ s Facebook page had 300 members . Some of the students received an email earlier this week from AIPAC warning that if they disrupted the speech , they would have their conference access revoked . An AIPAC official said on Thursday the message “ went out in error and was not authorized. ” “ I know nothing about that , ” Trump said in a interview on Thursday when asked if he had heard about the planned protests and whether he intended to respond . When he announced his candidacy last summer , Trump said some people crossing the U.S. border from Mexico were criminals and rapists , and promised to build a wall along the border . In December , he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country , on national security grounds . Last week , he told CNN : “ Islam hates us. ” The Anti-Defamation League and an organization of Reform rabbis condemned his comments . AIPAC , which is non-partisan , routinely hosts presidential hopefuls at its conference . Trump ’ s remaining Republican rivals , U.S . Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich , will address the group as well . “ The job of AIPAC is not to decide whose policies we like or look into the souls of people , ” said Seth Siegel , an AIPAC veteran who said he was not speaking on behalf of the organization . “ It ’ s the organization ’ s job to try to educate elected officials about how to deepen the U.S.-Israel relationship for the benefit of both parties , ” he said . “ Having Trump speak at the policy conference is unambiguously part of that mission . ”',\n",

They re part of a bigger Russian plot to harm Hillary , and get Trump elected , according to the intelligence community : Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others , including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman , according to U.S. officials . Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances . Sounds conspiracy-theorish , doesn t it ? This kind of thing is the stuff that the right-wing conspiracy theorists spin out of nothing . The only difference is that our intelligence officials actually know this is happening , rather than the conspiracy theorists making up their own info in the face of official truth.There is a legitimate concern about making the strain on our relationship with Russia worse than it is . However , that s not what McConnell seemed worried about back in September when this information first began coming to light . At the time , the White House had been looking for broad , bipartisan support from Congressional leaders in coming out with the information . They were worried about looking like they were , in fact , playing politics.McConnell , however , decided to threaten the White House with that accusation regardless : The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously . Republicans , however , were divided , with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests.According to several officials , McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics . He did not want this information getting out , although why is anybody s guess . We know that the RNC was hacked as well , but whatever those hacks discovered was never released : We now have high confidence that they hacked the D.N.C . and the R.N.C. , and conspicuously released no documents from the Republican organization , one senior administration official said , referring to the Russians . Why ? It raises all sorts of questions , including whether McConnell had an idea about that and was afraid of the GOP looking like they were actively working with Russia to secure a Trump presidency . With this information , McConnell looks almost like a Russian pawn , whether he actually is or not.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images',\n",

The plea agreement in Nevada federal court recounts the bizarre details leading up to Sanford s crimes , but differs from the initial criminal complaint in that it stops short of stating that Sandford wanted to shoot Trump . Instead , Sanford , who had overstayed a tourist visa by nearly a year , confessed to seizing the officer s gun and interfering with Trump s speech .

       " 'BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON - Once U.S. President Donald Trump returns from his overseas trip , the White House plans to launch its most aggressive effort yet to push back against allegations involving Russia and his presidential campaign , tackling head-on a scandal that has threatened to consume his young presidency . Trump ’ s advisers are planning to establish a “ war room ” to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his presidential campaign before and after November ’ s presidential election , while bringing new aides into the White House , administration officials and persons close to Trump told Reuters . The strategic shake-up comes as Republicans in Washington increasingly have fretted that the probe , continued chaos in the West Wing and Trump ’ s steady slide in opinion polls will derail the president ’ s drive to reform healthcare , cut taxes and rebuild the nation ’ s infrastructure . Upon Trump ’ s return , the administration will add experienced political professionals , including Trump ’ s former campaign manager , and possibly more lawyers to handle the Russia probe , which has gained new urgency since the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation , the sources said . Beyond pushing back at suggestions that Moscow is unduly influencing Trump ’ s administration , the messaging effort will also focus on advancing Trump ’ s stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of Washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of Trump ’ s campaign . A person in regular touch with the White House said it needed a different structure to focus on the “ new reality ” that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities , leaks that have increased in frequency since Trump fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey on May 9 . “ Since the firing of Comey , that really exposed the fact that the White House in its current structure ... is not prepared for really a one-front war , let alone a two-front war , ” the person said . “ They need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focused ” while “ also truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks. ” The White House declined to comment on plans for a “ war room ” but said Trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the president ’ s trip to Saudi Arabia , Israel , and Europe . A White House official confirmed plans to hold more rallies . Trump returns to Washington on Saturday from his first trip abroad as president . “ The president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the White House looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to D.C. , ” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders . Jared Kushner , a senior adviser to Trump , will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation , as will Steve Bannon , another top adviser who specializes in managing Trump ’ s populist appeal and shaping his political image , the sources said . Bannon and Trump ’ s chief of staff , Reince Priebus , have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week , they added . On Thursday , NBC News and the Washington Post reported that Kushner , who held several meetings with Russian officials following the election , is a focus of the probe , making him the first current White House official to be caught up in it , although Kushner , who is Trump ’ s son-in-law , has not been accused of any wrongdoing . Corey Lewandowski , Trump ’ s former campaign manager , is also expected to be part of the effort . Lewandowski , who has been seen in the White House recently , could join the administration as early as next week , a source close to him said . Lewandowski was fired by Trump in June 2016 over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against Democrat Hillary Clinton , but has remained a trusted adviser to Trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs . This month , the Justice Department named Robert Mueller , a former FBI director , as an independent special counsel in the probe . Trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasn ’ t done a more effective job at making the case that he isn ’ t implicated in the Russia probe and highlighting his administration ’ s successes , sources close to the president said . The White House declined to comment on the president ’ s frustrations . Another Republican close to the White House said the new team is taking a page out of former President Bill Clinton ’ s playbook . When Clinton faced impeachment in the late 1990s , he assembled a crisis-management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with Monica Lewinsky while allowing the rest of the White House to deal with day-to-day policy matters . “ The goal of the White House is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel , ” the Republican said . Christopher Ruddy , chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump friend , said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the White House to focus on issues that pump up his base voters . “ From my perspective , I think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best , which is talking about his agenda : jobs , trade and security , ” Ruddy said . Trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . The White House said other similar events are in the planning stages . Republicans in Congress are aching for Trump to leave the distraction of the Russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration . “ What we really want to be able to do is tend to our business , ” Mike Rounds , a Republican Senator from South Dakota , told Reuters . “ We ’ ve got a healthcare bill we ’ re working on . We ’ ve got tax reform that we think is important. ” Some of Trump ’ s donors , too , say they are concerned . Stanley Hubbard , a billionaire radio mogul from Minnesota , said he worries that the White House continues to be distracted by the Russia scandal , but laid some of the blame on Trump himself . “ He talks when he shouldn ’ t , ” he said . Former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said this week that Trump ’ s time in office has been a “ complete disaster ” aside from foreign affairs . Boehner , a fellow Republican , told an energy conference he supported efforts to “ get to the bottom ” of any potential interactions between Trump associates and the Russian government but described any calls to impeach Trump as the purview of “ the crazy left-wing Democratic colleagues of mine . ”',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS - The European Parliament will insist on quickly making the deal reached between the European Union and Britain on divorce terms legally binding , worried London may not honor a gentleman s agreement , the parliament s chief Brexit coordinator said . The EU and Britain , which is will leave the EU in March 2019 , agreed last Friday on the divorce terms in three key areas a financial settlement , citizens rights and how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland . The European Commission said on Monday the deal was not legally binding yet , but it regarded it as a deal between gentlemen with the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government . But Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday that the deal , which allows both sides to start talks on a future trade agreement crucial for Britain , was more of a statement of intent than a legally binding measure . This caused concern among EU officials that London may want to go back on the agreement . Remarks by David Davis that Phase One deal last week not binding were unhelpful and undermines trust . European Parliament text will now reflect this and insist agreement translated into legal text as soon as possible , Guy Verhofstadt , who leads the European Parliament Brexit coordination team , tweeted . He said that after Davis s unacceptable remarks , the European Parliament will ask EU leaders meeting on Brexit on Friday to formally make negotiations on a future trade agreement with London conditional on including the agreement so far in full in the treaty on Britain leaving the EU . A draft text which leaders are set to adopt on Friday already states that negotiations in the second phase can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully in legal terms as quickly as possible .',\n",
       " 'LJUBLJANA - Macedonia s prime minister said on Monday he hoped Skopje and Athens could soon reach a solution to a decades-long dispute over the former Yugoslav republic s name . Athens argues that the use of the name Macedonia implies territorial claim over Greece s own northerly region with the same name and has been blocking Skopje s efforts to join NATO and European Union over the issue . But Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he expected the two sides to move fast to find a solution . November 21 , 20 there will be a first meeting with ( U.N. mediator ) Matthew Nimetz and I hope we will find a solution rather than postpone it , Zaev said after meeting his Slovenian counterpart Miro Cerar . He said he expects Macedonia to start accession talks with the EU next year . The meeting in November will be the first with the U.N. mediator since Zaev took over in June . The Macedonia name dispute has dragged on for almost 26 years with no clear progress . Athens has previously insisted that Skopje use a compound name such as New or Upper Macedonia . The former prime minister , nationalist Nikola Gruevski , built his almost decade-long rule on nationalism and had refused to meet Greek demands . Macedonia , a small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people , declared independence in 1991 and avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia . It was later rocked by an insurgency among its large ethnic Albanian minority that almost tore the country apart in 2001 .',\n",

       " 'VIENNA - U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s administration pledged on Tuesday to show “ great strictness ” over restrictions on Iran ’ s nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers , but gave little indication of what that might mean for the agreement . The 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers restricts Tehran ’ s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic . Trump has called the agreement “ the worst deal ever negotiated ” . His administration is now carrying out a review of the accord which could take months , but it has said little about where it stands on specific issues . The Trump administration also gave few clues about any potential policy shift on Tuesday in a statement to a quarterly meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog ’ s Board of Governors . “ The United States will approach questions of JCPOA interpretation , implementation , and enforcement with great strictness indeed , ” the statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency ’ s ( IAEA ) 35-nation board said , citing the deal ’ s full name : the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action . But the U.S. statement , the first to the Board of Governors since Trump took office in January , also repeated language used by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama , for whom the deal was a legacy achievement . “ Iran must strictly and fully adhere to all commitments and technical measures for their duration , ” it said - wording identical to that used in the U.S. statement to the previous Board of Governors meeting in November . The IAEA , which polices the restrictions on Iran ’ s nuclear activities under the deal , last month produced a quarterly report saying that Iran ’ s stock of enriched uranium had halved after coming close to a limit imposed by the agreement . That report was the first to specify how much enriched uranium Iran has , thanks to a series of agreements between Tehran and major powers clarifying items that would not count toward the stock . Some major powers had criticized previous reports for not being specific enough on items such as the size of the enriched uranium stock , and the U.S. statement called for future reports to be as detailed . “ We welcome inclusion of the additional level of detail , and expect it will continue in the future , ” it said .',\n",
       " 'Has the entire world gone mad with political correctness ? Is there any chance of saving the UK from itself ? UPDATE : Labour Party politician Sadiq Khan has been elected London mayor the first Muslim to lead Europe s largest city.Election officials say Khan defeated Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by more than 300,000 votes , after first- and second-preference votes were allocated.The result came early Saturday , more than 24 hours after polls closed.Khan was elected to replace Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson after a campaign marked by U.S.-style negative campaigning.Goldsmith , a wealthy environmentalist , called Khan divisive and accused him of sharing platforms with Islamic extremists.Khan , who calls himself the British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists , accused Goldsmith of trying to scare and divide voters in a proudly multicultural city of 8.6 million people more than 1 million of them Muslim.Londoners go to the polls on Thursday to choose a replacement for the outgoing Mayor , Boris Johnson MP . Despite the fact the Labour Party is currently mired in an anti-Semitism scandal , if all things remain equal , expect the party s candidate Sadiq Khan MP to be confirmed in the early hours of Friday morning.Mr . Khan , 45 , has had a successful career in the Labour Party , being elected to parliament in 2005 , becoming a Minister of State in 2008 with a promotion in 2009 . He was a Shadow Secretary of State for Justice from 2010-15 , and has been running for London Mayor since then.POLLINGIn fact , as I predicted in January , the polls have changed very little since the beginning of the year . This is despite a negative-ad onslaught by the Conservative Party and its candidate Zac Goldsmith the multi-millionaire son of Eurosceptic royalty Sir James Goldsmith , and brother of socialite and Vanity Fair editor Jemima Khan.Mr . Goldsmith and his Back Zac campaign have used the last few months to highlight Sadiq Khan s proximity to Islamic extremists , extremism , and this past weekend , to anti-Semitism.But perhaps it speaks to the mindset of Londoners , and certainly the British capital s demographic shift , that such news has scarcely affected Mr. Khan.In January , a YouGov poll put Mr. Goldsmith on 35 to Mr. Khan s 45 per cent . When you take into account London s supplementary voting system , the numbers after the second preference votes are counted ended up 45-55 to Mr. Khan.Last week , that number stood at 40-6o to Mr. Khan . After second preference votes , the extremist-adjacent candidate has a 20 point poll lead.While last week s events when one of Mr. Khan s most prominent backers Ken Livingstone was implicated in a Hitler/anti-Semitism scandal may serve to keep some of Mr. Khan s voters at home , it is hard to imagine the Conservatives overturning such a drastic poll lead.A MUSLIM MAYOR ? Polling suggests some people are nervous about having someone like Mr. Khan near an office that wields so much power , responsibility , and cash.Private conversations with Westminster insiders often see Lutfur Rahman the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets raised as another example of a prominent Muslim mayor.Mr . Rahman was removed from office , accused by critics of playing sectarian politics with the area s Muslim population , of backing Islamists , and of distributing tax payer cash to his favoured Muslim groups to secure their support.Mr . Rahman was found guilty of corrupt and illegal practices and has perhaps set back the plight of the few , integrated British Muslims in elected life . He alongside politicians like Humza Yousaf , Sayeeda Warsi , Rushanara Ali , Shabana Mahmood , Yasmin Qureshi , Amjad Bashir , Naz Shah , and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh have created a deep distrust between British voters and Muslim politicians.In fact one third of Londoners remain suspicious of having a Muslim Mayor , and the likes of Sajid Javid or Syed Kamall suffer because of their co-religionists insistence on fellow-travelling with extremists , if not holding extremist views themselves.EXTREMISMAnd Mr. Khan can hardly claim a clean record . Mr. Goldsmith s attacks are not without basis , though they have been shrugged off as racism or Islamophobia with the assistance of the left s useful idiots like Owen Jones.Apart from his somewhat threatening statements about not voting for him while claiming that he is the West , Mr. Khan s own track record is perhaps one of the most sour of all Muslim politicians in the Western world.In 2001 he was the lawyer for the Nation of Islam in its successful High Court bid to overturn the 15-year-ban on its leader , Louis Farrakhan.In 2005 and 2006 he visited terror-charged Babar Ahmad in Woodhill Prison . Mr. Ahmed was extradited to the U.S. in 2012 , serving time in prison before being returned to the UK in 2015 . Mr. Ahmed pleaded guilty to the terrorist offences of conspiracy , and providing material support to the Taliban.And Mr. Khan also campaigned for the release and repatriation of Shaker Aamer , Britain s last Guantanamo detainee , who was returned to the UK in November.Both Messrs Aamer and Ahmed provided Mr. Khan with links to the advocacy group CAGE , which described the Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi as a beautiful young man , and which has campaigned on behalf of both men . Mr. Khan is reported to have shared a stage with five Islamic extremists , including at sex-segregated events . Even so , his poll numbers remain firm.On Friday morning , Londoners will likely get the news that their mayor for the next four years is a man with the judgement , priorities , and fellow travellers as laid out above . This , combined with an annual 16bn budget , and an army of police , bureaucrats , and officials , would make Mr. Khan one of the most powerful Muslims in the Western world.For entire story : Breitbart News',\n",
       " '( This version of the Sept. 14 story corrects to say that Weiner was defeated in the 2013 mayoral election , did not drop out , in last paragraph ) By Brendan Pierson NEW YORK - Former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner has asked a judge not to sentence him to prison after he admitted to sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl , igniting a “ sexting ” scandal that played a role in last year ’ s U.S. presidential election . In a filing in Manhattan federal court late on Wednesday , Weiner ’ s lawyers said Weiner acted out of the “ depths of an uncontrolled sickness. ” They argued Weiner should be sentenced to probation , including mental health treatment , and perform community service . Weiner , 53 , submitted his own letter to the court in which he apologized and said he was continuing to seek treatment . “ I don ’ t know how I will be able to make amends to the young person who I dragged into my sordid mess , ” he said . Weiner ’ s wife , Huma Abedin , an aide to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , has filed for divorce . She also submitted a letter to the court asking it to consider the impact of the sentence on the couple ’ s son . Weiner pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor . The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years , though prosecutors said as part of a plea deal that they would consider a term between 21 and 27 months “ fair and appropriate. ” The investigation into Weiner ’ s exchanges with the teenage girl roiled the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in its final days , when authorities found emails on Weiner ’ s laptop from Abedin . The discovery prompted James Comey , then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , to announce in late October that the agency was reviewing the messages to determine whether to reopen its investigation into Clinton ’ s use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state . Clinton has said the announcement contributed to her upset loss to Republican Donald Trump , who had accused her of endangering national security by using the private server . Comey testified before Congress in May that the emails found on Weiner ’ s computer included classified information . Trump fired Comey in May amid the FBI ’ s probe into whether Trump ’ s campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton , a claim the president has denied . Weiner served parts of New York City for 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before resigning in 2011 , when it emerged that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages with women . Two years later , he ran for New York City mayor , but was defeated in the Democratic primary after more lewd messages became public .',\n",
       " 'On CNN s State of the Union yesterday , Reince Priebus fielded a question about Gen. Michael Flynn s insistence that it s perfectly rational to fear Muslims . Poor Priebus tried to deflect and failed miserably : There are some people within that particular religion that we do fear . So what are we going to do about it ? We re going to cause massive immigration delays and blow yet another hole in the deficit by going forward with the Muslim ban . Or rather , we re potentially going to piss off some allies by suspending all immigration from certain countries : We don t believe in religious tests and are not blanketly judging an entire religion , but , in fact , we will try to pinpoint the problems and temporarily suspend those areas from coming into the United States until a better vetting system is in place . And yet , they want to implement a values test , through which people can lie to their heart s content . Given the Trump train s Islamophobia , such a values test could actually look like a religious test.He s targeting both refugees and other immigrants from areas where there might be a problem with terrorism that could end up getting exported here , and will use both DHS and the Department of State to pinpoint these countries , and we ll develop our extreme vetting and all will be right with the world.As reported everywhere about five million times , we already have an extensive vetting system in place for refugees , whatever Trump , Priebus , and the rest of the fear-mongerers keep pushing.We likewise have a very lengthy , complex , and extensive vetting process in place for other immigrants . Most applicants need a U.S. sponsor a relative or potential employer as assurance that they aren t coming here to be a burden on our system . The whole process starts with a petition , and then goes to National Visa Center screening if the petition is approved.There are also in-depth interviews that take place , along with about a squillion forms that must be filled out and submitted to the NVC . When they finally come to the U.S. , they generally have a packet about an inch thick which U.S. Customs and Border Protection evaluates before granting entry into the U.S. From there , immigrants get sent to Customs and Immigration Services for processing.Trump would add a values test to this already-lengthy and complex process . This is to ensure that no potential Muslim extremists could successfully immigrate here , and is actually not entirely without precedent here . However , our current law states that we will not apply values tests to potential immigrants.Other parts of the plan , including the rest of his extreme vetting , could actually strain State Department and DHS resources and cause major delays . How bad the whole thing will be depends heavily on what countries they plan to target , which could be limited to the Middle East , but could just as easily stretch into Europe and parts of Africa . Many of our immigrants come from Africa who knows who this will piss off ? All of this could also become quite expensive , but it seems the deficit is suddenly not a major issue to the GOP . After all , we re supposed to get this yuuuuuuge influx of jobs , which means a yuuuuuge influx of tax dollars despite the tax cuts . This is so not going to work.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images',\n",

In a news release , officials said Andrew Joseph Alemao , 28 , was observed throwing two tomatoes at Trump , the real estate mogul and front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Alemao has been charged with disorderly conduct , a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $ 625 or 30 days in prison . He is currently being held in the Johnson County Jail.He was taken into custody by the Secret Service and the UIPD after throwing the tomatoes , the release said.At least three Sanders supporters were apparently escorted by security out of the rally , with Trump shouting , Get em outta here ! to the cheers of his fans in the crowd.Not one of the tomatoes actually hit Trump.But it shouldn t matter.Frankly , regardless of how vile , obnoxious and ultimately dangerous Trump might be , there s simply no excuse for anyone to engage in physical violence against him , or any public figures for that matter . It s childish , unacceptable behavior especially for liberals who ought to know better . If activists are incapable of making an argument using words , evidence and reason , they should figure out how it s done , rather than embarrassing the rest of us ( especially other Bernie supporters ) by lashing out like an infant who refuses to eat and hurls his food at the wall in protest.The same goes for pie attacks against William Kristol and Ann Coulter , or red paint attacks against Condoleezza Rice . In fact , at the time , I wrote something similar when a protester attacked George W. Bush by throwing shoes at the former president . Feel free to applaud these kinds of attacks I m sure it s cathartic but know that by encouraging such atrociously violent , kneejerk behavior , you re only encouraging more of it.And , so , don t be surprised when conservative activists retaliate with the same thing against liberal leaders and celebrities , not unlike how a pissed off wingnut attacked Hillary Clinton back in 2014 . Put another way : it s probably not difficult for Trump supporters to worm their way into Democratic rallies.Just to be clear : it s entirely possible that the tomato-tosser wasn t a Bernie supporter at all .

       " \"21st Century Wire says After a long drawn out round of bilateral peace talks in Geneva Switzerland this week , Russia and the United States announced a plan for a 48 hour ceasefire in Syria , scheduled to take effect at sundown Monday.Incredibly , the cornerstone of this agreement rests on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry , both agreeing ( for now anyway ) that they would both be targeting the terrorist opposition force , Al Nusra Front ( al Qaeda in Syria , supported covertly by both the Saudi Arabia and the US/CIA ) who recently rebranded themselves to Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham in cynical desperate move to avoid being targeted by military airstrikes.Back in May , when another ceasefire was proposed , 21WIRE warned that it was only a ploy by the US to buy more time for rebels to re-arm and repair broken rat lines from Turkey into northern Syria . That turned out to be 100 % correct , despite the fact the western media outlets were duped by Washington s desperate diplomatic ploy reinforced by a multi-million dollar , New York City-based PR campaign targeting social media and funded by George Soros and others , which was marketed using the tagline # AleppoIsBurning.Are we seeing more of the same this week in Geneva ? For a comprehensive analysis on what this latest temporary ceasefire agree really means , and where it could be heading , watch his excellent segment featuring political analyst Ammar Waqqaf . Watch : According to Kerry , the plan is to ensure that Syrian government forces will not carry out combat missions where the so-called moderate opposition is present.Speaking of fight against Al-Nusra and its efforts to blend with moderate rebels , Kerry stressed going on Al-Nusra is not a concession to anybody but is profoundly in the interests of the US .

Taking the floor , the Russian FM confirmed that Russia and US had agreed to coordinate airstrikes in Syria , provided there is a sustained period of reduced violence . The first step toward the implementation of this clause will be a 48-hour ceasefire in Syria , Lavrov said.Lavrov elaborated that the ceasefire comes into effect on September 12 and should last for at least seven days . ( ) Despite the mistrust and attempt to disrupt what we have agreed upon , we managed to work out a package of documents , there are five of them . It allows us to set an effective coordination in the fight against terrorism , to expand the humanitarian access to distressed population , first and foremost in Aleppo , Lavrov said.Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained in the agreements , they will not be made available to general public , Lavrov said . We can not make these documents public . They contain rather serious , sensitive information .

       " 'SEOUL - North Korea s latest defector , a young soldier known only by his family name Oh , is a quiet , pleasant man who has nightmares about being returned to the North , his surgeon said on Thursday . He s a pretty nice guy , said lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee , who has been operating and caring for the 24-year-old . Oh has become a focus of worldwide attention after he was badly wounded by fellow North Korean soldiers as he scrambled across the border in the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South on Nov. 13 . Video of Oh s escape released on Wednesday showed him stumbling over the border and being dragged unconscious through the undergrowth by South Korean troops . Surgeon Lee has been almost the only person to speak with Oh since he arrived at the hospital , he told in an interview at his office at Ajou University Hospital , just a few floors away from where the defector lies guarded by South Korean special forces and intelligence officers . The surgeon , who has hung a South Korean flag in the soldier s room , said he is avoiding subjects that may disturb his patient . Oh is eating his first clear liquid food such as broths , and can smile , talk , and use his hands , Lee said . But when his patient woke on Sunday he cried out in pain , and Lee said he is still anxious about the South Korean guards . Lee said Oh told him that he had joined the North Korean army when he was 17 , right after secondary school graduation . The soldier s hair is styled like a jarhead , like a U.S. Marine , so I actually joked why don t you join the South Korean Marines ? He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again . Medical teams have worked for days to remove the shards of at least four bullets from Oh s body , stitch up his shredded organs , and treat pre-existing conditions including tuberculosis , hepatitis B , and a case of massive intestinal worms , Lee said . He s a quite strong man , said Lee . Since Oh s defection , North Korea appeared to have replaced all its security guards on the border , an intelligence source in the South told Yonhap news agency on Thursday . Lee said that when the defector arrived in an American military helicopter at the hospital which is equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment and is used to treat VIP visitors such as visiting U.S. presidents - he came with zero personal information . On the flight in , American army flight medics had fought to keep Oh alive , jabbing a large needle into his chest to treat a collapsed lung . Oh was immediately wheeled into a diagnostic room where doctors confirmed he was suffering from massive internal bleeding . We knew then that we didn t have time to hesitate , Lee said , standing in that room Thursday night . Two major surgeries were required to remove the bullets and patch Oh back together , and the medical team pumped as much as 12 liters of new blood into his body . The normal body has less than half as much blood . He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him that much blood , Lee said . Lee has been playing South Korean pop music and American films and TV shows for his patient , but has not exposed him to any news coverage . Among the shows , Oh showed a liking for the French-American thriller Transporter 3 , comedy Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman ; and the crime-solving TV series CSI , Lee said . Most North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea s intelligence agency once they arrive in the South before being sent to a resettlement center for a three-month education on life in the South . After they are released , central and local governments provide 7 million won ( $ 6,450 ) in cash over a year , as well as support in housing , education and job training . Police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security and safety . Even if Oh fully recovers , some scars will stay for the rest of his life , the surgeon said . Among the longest lasting wounds will be the damage to his colon , which was shredded by a bullet and had to be stitched back together in seven places . It s a lifelong complication for the patient , so he s better to be very cautious in his diet , said the surgeon . Besides the potential for further medical complications , Lee says he is most worried about making sure Oh recovers psychologically . The soldier has already told him he had a nightmare about being returned to the North . The surgeon said he has asked senior South Korean military officials who are eager to question the soldier to hold off while he recovers . This North Korean guy is not going anywhere , Lee said . He is staying in South Korea . So we don t need to be hasty .',\n",

A police prosecutor said officers found images which we presume to be real of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on Peter Madsen s computer in a laboratory he ran . That , together with new post-mortem evidence showing Wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals around or shortly after her death , was adding to the case against Madsen , the prosecutor , Jakob Buch-Jepsen , told the Copenhagen court . DNA tests from Madsen s nails , face and neck showed a clear match with Wall s , Buch-Jepsen said , though the exact cause of death remained unknown . Our suspicion hasn t changed , it has been strengthened since ( the last hearing on ) September 5 , he added . Madsen , who denies murdering Wall and another charge of mutilating her body , appeared in court via video link dressed in a green boilersuit . He said the computer searched by police was not his . They are the space laboratory s tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory , he said . The court heard he had been working on building a space rocket in the lab . He remained calm during the pre-trial session , sitting with his hands folded most of the time . The court ordered him detained for another four weeks as investigations continued . Wall , a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen , went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre ( 56-foot ) craft in August . Madsen has told the court in past hearings Wall died accidentally , saying she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on his UC3 Nautilus submarine . On August 23 , police identified a headless female torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. Madsen has also denied amputating her limbs , saying he tried to bury her whole body at sea .',\n",

The lie was so incredibly easy to debunk that it s hard to imagine the White House will even try to defend it . Tillerson , for his part , wore the grim expression of man who was awaiting a guard to escort him to the gallows.Trump : `` Never has there been a president '' besides FDR `` who 's passed more legislation , who 's done more things than what we 've done .

       " 'A horrifying incident took place in the early hours of Monday morning in Finsbury Park in London.A van plowed into a group of Muslim worshipers as they were leaving prayers at a pair of North London mosques.Yep you read that right . A terrorist attack has happened in London against Muslims . This incident follows two recent terrorist attacks in London in which vehicles have been used as weapons , both on bridges over the Thames River . So far this attack has left one person is dead and 10 others injured . This is being treated as a terrorist attack , said Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told reporters . He added that the driver of the van was arrested on suspicion of murder.According to the Washington Post , witnesses said the driver of the vehicle was heard shouting that he wanted to kill Muslims.Thankfully , the driver didn t get away . The Washington Post reports that Abdulrahman Aidroos and his friends were attending to an elderly man who had collapsed on the ground when suddenly he saw a man in a van driving straight into us . When the driver of the van jumped out of the vehicle and tried to run I tackled him on the floor until the police came , Aidroos told the BBC . When he was running , he said I want to kill more people , I want to kill more Muslims . It s absolutely appalling and to think another human being has done this.Though it s clear there s something wrong with this attacker , we need to stop fear mongering when it comes to Muslims . The worst has now happened as a result.Muslims are entirely separate from ISIS just like the KKK is separate from the Christian church . Just like Nazism is entirely separate from Germans . There are bad people evil people in the world . But attacking innocent people won t stop the problem or rid the world of evil . It just hurts innocent people and their loved ones.We need to stop being so divided and scapegoating other people . That won t solve any problems it ll just create new ones.Featured Image by Carl Court/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Marco Rubio s staff had to exit the building they were working in when the senator began smoking from the trouser region . Alarms and sprinklers were set off , leading to an investigation the fire chief was able to dismiss as self-inflicted liar , liar pants on fire . The incident happened when Rubio , who tells a wonderful story about how his parents came to the United States to escape the Castro regime , meaning they would have come in 1959 . Unfortunately , records have proven , and Rubio has himself admitted , that the actual date his parents migrated to Miami was 1956 , when Castro was still living and plotting from Mexico.So why the discrepancy ? Rubio says he was passing along the family s oral history . Yes , oral history . That s when you don t like your family s actual history so you make something up . My family , for example , landed in New Hampshire , but since nobody cares about anything in the 1620s but Plymouth , I am now a direct descendent of the Mayflower according to oral history . That was easy.Rubio s ridiculous answer fits in with the motif of the Republican party of derp . If something doesn t make sense , ignore it until it just goes away . Rubio comes along with his I appeal to Latinos mentality , some of which is a direct result of the lies he told . How much will those same Latinos respect his plight when they learn Rubio s parents came here voluntarily , not on a raft as refugees escaping life in prison or worse . They entered the country and asked to start working and were shown a path to citizenship.There is , of course , nothing wrong with that story . It s a similar story to almost every family if you go back to their first generation . For some reason , Marco Rubio and his family needed to add things that never happened to their lives for effect . Featured image from Gage Skidmore',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a letter on Saturday that he will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to address matters former FBI Director James Comey brought up this week in testimony to the same panel . In a letter seen by Reuters , Sessions told Senator Richard Shelby , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce , Justice , Science and Related Agencies , that the intelligence committee is the “ most appropriate ” place to address matters that came up during Comey ’ s hearing on Thursday . The letter did not say whether Sessions planned to give public testimony or to appear before the panel behind closed doors . “ In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey ’ s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum , ” Sessions said in the letter . The committee “ is the most appropriate forum for such matters , as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant , classified information , ” he added . The Senate panel is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election . In March , Sessions removed himself from any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the elections , but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose that he met last year with Russia ’ s ambassador . In testimony to the Senate panel on Thursday , Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBI ’ s investigation of possible collusion by people in Trump ’ s campaign with Russia ’ s alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election . Comey ’ s appearance raised new questions about the attorney general ’ s relationship with Russian officials and others with ties to President Vladimir Putin . One question is whether Sessions had any undisclosed meetings with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak or other Russians during the campaign or after Trump ’ s inauguration . In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years , Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9 . Sessions had planned to appear before the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees , but the deputy attorney general will take his place , the letter said .',\n",
       " 'KARACHI , Pakistan - Pakistan has rejected U.S. criticism of its efforts to fight terrorism , saying it should not be made a scapegoat for the failure of the U.S. military to win the war in Afghanistan . U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his policy for Afghanistan on Monday , stepping up the military campaign against Taliban insurgents and singling out Pakistan for harboring them . U.S. officials later warned that aid to Pakistan might be cut and Washington might downgrade nuclear-armed Pakistan s status as a major non-NATO ally , in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to America s longest-running war . Pakistan s powerful military chief , General Qamar Javed Bajwa , met U.S . Ambassador David Hale on Wednesday and told him Pakistan was actively working for peace in Afghanistan . We have done a lot ... and shall keep on doing our best , not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy , Bajwa was quoted in an army press statement as telling Hale . Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation over the U.S. criticism , reiterating Pakistan s denial that it harbors militants . They should not make Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in Afghanistan , Asif said in an interview with Geo TV late on Tuesday . A group of influential Pakistani clerics including Sami-ul Haq , who runs a Islamic seminary where many senior Afghan Taliban studied , angrily condemned the United States . America is the enemy of the Muslim ummah ( community ) , Haq told a press briefing along with other clerics who preach a jihadist doctrine . The government of Pakistan should quit the alliance for war against so-called terrorism , Haq added . The heavens will not fall if America gets angry with us . Pakistan has for years been battling homegrown Islamist militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations . But critics say the Pakistani military nurtures other Islamist factions , including the Afghan Taliban , which are seen as useful to Pakistan s core confrontation with old rival India . Asif said Pakistan had suffered great losses from Islamist militancy - the government estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks , including 17,000 Pakistanis killed - since Pakistan joined the U.S. war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade , especially after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid . Last year , a U.S. drone strike killed then-Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in southwestern Pakistan , an attack Islamabad protested as a violation of its sovereignty . Pakistan has denied knowledge that either bin Laden or Mansour were in the country .',\n",
       " 'WELLINGTON - Israel s ambassador to New Zealand on Wednesday appealed to the pop star Lorde to meet him after she canceled a show in Tel Aviv after appeals from activists for her to shun Israel as a protest against its treatment of Palestinians . Itzhak Gerberg , Israel s ambassador to New Zealand , said in a public letter it was regrettable that the concert had been called off and the boycott of his country represented hostility and intolerance . I invite you to meet me in person to discuss Israel , its achievements and its role as the only democracy in the Middle East , Gerberg said on the Embassy of Israel s Facebook page . Lorde s representatives did not immediately respond to request for comment on her response or whether she planned to meet the ambassador . The 21-year-old New Zealand singer had been slated to perform in Tel Aviv in June as part of a global tour to promote her chart-topping second album Melodrama . Campaigners have been urging her to scrap the show , calling in an open letter on Dec. 21 for her to pull out as part of a boycott to oppose Israel s occupation of the Palestinian territories . Playing in Tel Aviv will be seen as giving support to the policies of the Israeli government , even if you make no comment on the political situation , campaigners Justine Sachs and Nadia Abu-Shanab , wrote on news website The Spinoff . We believe that an economic , intellectual and artistic boycott is an effective way of speaking out , they said . Lorde said on Twitter at the time she was speaking with many people about this and considering all options . Eran Arielli , the promoter of the concert , said on Facebook on Sunday that the show was off . The truth is I was naive to think that an artist of her age would be able to absorb the pressure involved in coming to Israel , he wrote in Hebrew . The Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement was launched in 2005 as a non-violent campaign to press Israel to heed international law and end its occupation of territory Palestinians seek for a state . Artists who have boycotted Israel include Pink Floyd s Roger Waters and Elvis Costello . Other major stars , such as Elton John , Aerosmith , Guns and Roses , the Rolling Stones , Justin Bieber and Rihanna have performed in recent years in Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing government has long campaigned against the BDS movement , describing it as anti-Semitic and an attempt to erase Israel s legitimacy .

       " '- President Donald Trump ’ s administration on Wednesday revoked landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice , reversing a signature initiative of former Democratic President Barack Obama . Reversing the Obama guidelines stands to inflame passions in the latest conflict in America between believers in traditional values and social progressives , and is likely to prompt more of the street protests that followed Trump ’ s Nov. 8 election . Obama had instructed public schools last May to let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity , threatening to withhold funding for schools that did not comply . Transgender people hailed the step as victory for their civil rights . Trump , a Republican who took office last month , rescinded those guidelines , even though they had been put on hold by a federal judge , arguing that states and public schools should have the authority to make their own decisions without federal interference . The Justice and Education departments will continue to study the legal issues involved , according to the new , superseding guidance that will be sent to public schools . About 200 people gathered in front of the White House to protest against Trump ’ s action , waving rainbow flags and chanting : “ No hate , no fear , trans students are welcome here. ” The rainbow flag is the symbol of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender , or LGBT , people . “ We all know that Donald Trump is a bully , but his attack on transgender children today is a new low , ” said Rachel Tiven , chief executive of Lambda Legal , which advocates for LGBT people . Conservatives such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , who spearheaded the lawsuit challenging the Obama guidance , hailed the Trump administration action . “ Our fight over the bathroom directive has always been about former President Obama ’ s attempt to bypass Congress and rewrite the laws to fit his political agenda for radical social change , ” said Paxton , a Republican . Transgender legal advocates have criticized the “ states ’ rights ” argument , saying federal law and civil rights are matters for the federal government to enforce , not the states . White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration was pressed to act now because of the pending U.S. Supreme Court case , G.G . versus Gloucester County School Board . That case pits a Virginia transgender boy , Gavin Grimm , against officials who want to deny him use of the boys ’ room at his high school . Although the Justice Department is not a party in the case , it typically would want to make its views heard . The Trump administration action on Wednesday also withdrew an Education Department letter in support of Grimm ’ s case . “ I ’ ve faced my share of adversaries in rural Virginia . I never imagined that my government would be one of them . We will not be beaten down by this administration , ” Grimm , 17 , told the protest outside the White House . The federal law in question , known as Title IX , bans sex discrimination in education . But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person ’ s gender identity . Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Obama guidelines “ did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of Title IX. ” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to ensure Title IX and his state ’ s civil rights protections are enforced . “ President Trump ’ s decision to rescind anti-discrimination protections for transgender students is yet another cruel move by an administration committed to divisive policies that roll back the clock on civil rights , ” he said in a statement . The courts are likely to have the final say over whether Title IX covers transgender students . The Supreme Court could pass on that question in the Virginia case and allow lower courts to weigh in , or go ahead and decide what the law means . Obama ’ s Education Department issued the guidance in response to queries from school districts across the country about how to accommodate transgender students in gender-segregated bathrooms . It also covered a host of other issues , such as the importance of addressing transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns and schools ’ responsibility to prevent harassment and bullying of transgender children . Thirteen states led by Texas sued to stop the Obama guidelines , and a U.S. district judge in Texas temporarily halted their full implementation . The White House previously boasted of Trump ’ s support for LGBT rights , noting in a Jan. 31 statement that he was the first Republican presidential nominee to mention the community in his nomination acceptance speech . “ Revoking the guidance shows that the president ’ s promise to protect LGBT rights was just empty rhetoric , ” James Esseks , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’ s LGBT project , said in a statement .',\n",

       " 'RIJEKA , Croatia - In a Croatian port sits a boat built to carry bananas from Africa to Italy , that laid mines for Nazi Germany and was sunk by Allied planes before it was salvaged as the personal yacht of a globe-trotting communist leader . Josip Broz Tito and the state he led - Yugoslavia - have long passed into history , and the boat , the Galeb ( Seagull ) , was left to rust in a corner of Rijeka s once mighty docks . Now , with Rijeka readying to become European Capital of Culture in 2020 , city authorities have secured European Union money to restore the 117-metre ( 384-feet ) boat as a museum , just as debate in Croatia rages over the life and deeds of the man who graced the pink mattress in the front port-side cabin . If the Galeb was a symbol of Tito s prestige on the world stage a communist leader welcome in ports West as well as East its restoration is part of Croatia s own tortured process of reconciliation with its 20th century history . To conservatives in Croatia , Tito who was born in what is today Croatia to a Croat father and Slovene mother was a totalitarian dictator : to look fondly on him means to be nostalgic for a shared federal state that denied Croats their own until they forged one in a 1991-95 war . Liberals , however , recall his guerrilla fight against the Nazis and the relative freedom and prosperity of Yugoslavs compared to those who lived in the Soviet Union or in its shadow . They see in the disdain of conservatives a thinly veiled fondness for the World War Two Croatian state that collaborated with the Nazis but was snuffed out with Tito s Partisan victory a sentiment that has gained a foothold in mainstream Croatian politics in recent years . It is a tug-of-war over history and identity that was encapsulated this month in the renaming by Zagreb s city council of the capital s Marshal Tito Square to Republic of Croatia square . Days later , the government ordered the removal of a plaque near the site of a World War Two concentration camp that bore a notorious slogan associated with the Nazi puppet regime in Croatia . We live in a time when history is being reinvented retroactively , said Ivan Sarar , who as head of culture at Rijeka s city council is in charge of its 2020 makeover . It s interesting that just by undertaking this ( restoration ) we have already been declared revisionists , he told Reuters . After years of false-starts , work on restoring the Galeb is imminent a mammoth , multi-million-euro task to recreate the 1950s chic of Tito s floating palace , host to over 100 heads of state and some of Hollywood s finest . Some of the furniture remains - in Tito s cabin , his turquoise-tiled bathroom and the adjacent salon with doors that open to the deck . But the ship itself is little more than a rotting hull . The Galeb was the stage for Tito s major contribution to history , said Sarar , a showcase for the non-aligned movement he helped found in answer to the East-West polarization of the Cold War . But Sarar stressed : We won t be soft on anyone . He noted Tito s cozy ties with dictators around the world , the exodus of Italian residents of Rijeka when he took the city as part of Yugoslavia , and his denial of democracy during 35 years of one-man rule until his death in 1980 . Yugoslavia fell apart in war a decade later and some 135,000 people were killed . It was Tito s seizure of Rijeka and the Istrian peninsula that cemented his status in this part of Croatia as a liberator . Dozens of streets in Istria still bear his name , as do others in the Balkans - most notably in Serbia , once the dominant republic in Yugoslavia . Conservatives , however , struck a blow with the renaming of Zagreb s Marshal Tito Square , part of a deal struck by the mayor to secure his majority in the city assembly . The man behind the initiative , leading right-wing politician Zlatko Hasanbegovic , told that while Tito was undeniably a significant historical figure , so were Napoleon , Stalin and Lenin . In all countries , streets and squares bear the names of those who embody the values with which the entire nation identifies itself , he said , describing the restoration of the Galeb as part of an attempt to revive the cult of Tito . Those insisting on it should ask themselves how the tens of thousands of victims of Yugoslav communism look on that kind of quasi-cultural exhibitionism . In Rijeka , Sarar denied planning any kind of homage to Tito . We want to create a place for dialogue , away from the current situation of extreme black , white and red truths that lead nowhere , he said . It s bound to be difficult .',\n",

       " 'GENEVA - A United Nations human rights panel called on the Russian Federation on Monday to step up prosecutions of racist attacks by ultra-nationalists and neo-Nazis and of hate speech by politicians . Russian authorities must intensify measures to vigorously combat racist behavior in sports , particularly in football , and ensure that sports regulatory bodies investigate manifestations of racism , xenophobia and intolerance , the U.N. Committee against Racial Discrimination ( CERD ) said . Fines or administrative sanctions should be imposed for such cases . The panel , referring to the upcoming ( 2018 ) World Cup , expresses its concern that racist displays remain deeply entrenched among football fans , especially against persons belonging to ethnic minorities and people of African descent . Russia has pledged to crack down on racism and fan violence as it faces increased scrutiny before hosting the World Cup finals next summer . Russian Premier League champions Spartak Moscow and rivals Dynamo Moscow were each fined 250,000 rubles ( $ 4,250 ) over fans racist behavior , the Russian Football Union ( RFU ) said last month . The 18 independent experts , who reviewed Russia s record and those of seven other countries at a session that ended on Friday , issued their findings on Monday . Igor Barinov , head of the Federal Agency for Ethnic Affairs of the Russian Federation , told the panel on Aug. 4 that Moscow had taken measures against the propagation of racist ideas . Russia consistently combats the glorification of Nazism - made a crime in 2014 - the propaganda of Nazi ideas and attempts at racial hatred or discrimination , he said . In 2016 , officials had identified 1,450 extremist crimes , 993 had been sent to court and 934 people were found guilty , he said . The U.N. panel said violent racist attacks had decreased in recent years , but added : Violent racist attacks undertaken by groups such as neo-Nazi groups and Cossack patrols , targeting particularly people from Central Asia and the Caucasus and persons belonging to ethnic minorities including migrants , the Roma and people of African descent , remain a pressing problem . It called for an end to de facto racial profiling by the police , decrying arbitrary identity checks and unnecessary arrests . Racist hate speech is still used by officials and politicians , especially during election campaigns , and remains unpunished , it said , recommending investigations . Russia still lacks anti-discrimination legislation and the definition of extremist activity in its federal law remains vague and broad , it said . Regarding Crimea , seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 , the panel voiced concern at the fate of Crimean Tatar representative institutions , such as the outlawing of the Mejlis , the Crimean Tatar s semi-official legislature , the closure of several media outlets , and allegations of disappearances , criminal and administrative prosecutions , mass raids , and interrogations .',\n",
       " \"The actors and actresses of Fox News have received their marching orders and the run to November will officially be the propaganda machine for Donald Trump .

Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want , he turned his attention to the two former presidents , George W. and George H.W .

The uneducated bigots crawled out of the woodwork to demand the country be great again and ( insert required amount of rhetoric and lies ) .As the stupidity gained steam and made its way towards a downhill run to Cleveland , the party began to fracture . The pledge they made Trump sign now makes them look like massive hypocrites . What they re left with are fights of the magnitude of Gingrich versus Bush : Gingrich : `` When [ HW , W & Romney ] were the nominees they expected all of us to support them .

Tazzy Quest ( @ tazzyquest ) June 23 , 2017Sketch artists have long been common to courtrooms , but they are a novelty for the White House , at least for the last quarter of a century . Every presidential administration for the last 25 years has allowed cameras in the press briefings , but now that the heat is on in the Russia investigation and now with an administration that lies more often than they tell the truth , news outlets have to get creative and good old analog sketch drawings it is . Hennessy isn t exclusive to CNN . There s a chance other news outlets might do the same thing.Alienating the media is perhaps one of the worst decisions in an administration full of nothing but bad decisions . The Bush administration got away with sending us into two illegal wars because they were nice to the media . Instead , the Trump administration has nothing but hostility toward the mainstream media and as a result , for the first time since cameras were allowed in press briefings , the mainstream media is doing its job . In other words , Trump can credit the media near blackout for his low approval numbers and even for the aggressive approach to the Russian investigation.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'HONG KONG - For anyone digging into Hong Kong s history , the official archives might not be the place to look . The office of the chief executive , Hong Kong s leader , failed to hand over any official records at all for eight of the 20 years since it came under Chinese rule in 1997 , according to the government department that manages the archives . The Security Bureau only did it for 10 . Researchers say the problem is that Hong Kong , under roughly 150 years of British colonial rule and the first 20 years of Chinese rule , has never had a law regulating how government records should be kept or destroyed . As a result , the document retention that researchers see as necessary for keeping a record of the past has been somewhat spotty within Hong Kong . Under British rule , the archiving of documents in Hong Kong was also lax . In 1994 and 1995 , for example , the Government House gave nothing to the archives . But thanks to a constant flow of correspondence between the colonial government and London , Britain would have stored a copy of most official records , according to researchers . After the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997 , that back-up mechanism disappeared , leading to concerns that fragments of Hong Kong s history might slip away for good . Unlike Hong Kong , China has a set of archive laws , under which officials failing to file records can face administrative sanctions , or face charges if the case constitutes a crime . But researchers say that for any Hong Kong-related documents kept by China , access would be difficult . Simon Chu , the former head of the Government Records Service who has been advocating for an archives law , said that prior to 1997 researchers could count on finding records in Britain , even if they were lost in Hong Kong . After 1997 , you don t have this kind of luxury , he said . Connie Lo , a documentary director digging into the 1967 Communist-led riots in Hong Kong , found almost nothing on the subject in the government archives . She was , however , able to find material in Britain s National Archives for her film Vanished Archives , which premiered in Hong Kong this year . Fears over record retention were highlighted last year when the government of former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said it had kept no records of informal meetings with local groups over a controversial land development project . Hong Kong s current leader , Carrie Lam , has said she places great importance on the integrity of government records , and that she supports passing an archives law . She said she would pursue a law after receiving a report from the Law Reform Commission , which is studying the issue . The commission , however , has been considering the issue for four years and only expects to start consultations on the subject next year . Activists like Chu are anxious that records of sensitive information , such as government decisions during the 2014 pro-democracy street protests could be destroyed with impunity . I m very pessimistic about that , Chu said . One former senior government official , speaking on condition of anonymity , also admitted to throwing out some documents in order to protect a former top official . He declined to say what the documents contained . But he suggested the practice might be widespread in the civil service . For some of the most sensitive issues , there would not even be a record , he said . The Government Records Service said it received 25 reports of unauthorized destruction of records in the past six years , and disciplinary actions were taken against four officers in four cases .',\n",
       " 'While Republicans and their NRA puppet masters refuse to acknowledge it , we have a gun violence problem in America today . Almost like clockwork , anytime there is a shooting the right twists themselves into pretzels to blame anything but the easy availability of guns to , shall we say , crazy people.Each time , for instance , a pro-gun Republican shoots up a building , conservatives will fallaciously claim that he was a Black Lives Matter protester , or ignore their raving-mad right-wing rants and love of weapons , or claim the shooter was a Progressive because he was formerly employed by an insurance company by that name , or even say that a man who shot up a Planned Parenthood in an effort to stop abortion was a transgendered leftist activist who was trying to rob a bank . They spend so much time focusing on inventing stories that they completely miss the one trait all of these attacks share : the weapon used was a gun.While they ignore the issues , the right bellows that the solution is more guns , not fewer . But a recent study the largest of its kind to date puts that assertion largely to rest . A research team reviewed 130 high-quality studies conducted in ten countries over six decades and found that the tyrannical attempts by those of us on the left who want to restrict crazy people s access to guns because we are sick of seeing dead children on a daily basis , aren t at all misguided , as conservatives often claim.While researchers stopped short of saying they have proved conclusively that firearm restrictions reduce deaths , the study provides plenty of evidence to suggest this is the case . Across countries , instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate , we saw a reduction , lead researcher Julian Santaella-Tenorio from Columbia University told Vox . The study analyzed law changes in the United States , Australia , Austria , Brazil , South Africa , and other countries . No new data was collected . Instead , the researchers observed the big picture by taking a look at what the data says when all the studies are examined together . Santaella-Teonorio explained : The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths . The findings do not note one specific law that has caused gun violence to decrease like an assault weapon ban , or a ban on high-capacity magazines , because the diversity among countries makes this difficult . However , in countries that overhauled their firearm regulations broadly , the changes shared similar characteristics , according to the researcher : South Africa s Firearm Control Act of 2000 , for example , contained all three of these measures , and a study of five South African cities found a 13.6 percent reduction in firearm homicides each year for the next five years . Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed , the researchers say , although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides . To combat mass shootings , Australia passed similar legislation in 1996 . Thanks to the new laws , firearm homicide rates decreased by 4.8 percent , and suicides by 9.9 percent . There have only been two mass shootings in the country in the two decades since.But even the smallest changes , such as background check requirements and storage regulations , can have a huge impact . Laws restricting the purchase of ( e.g . background checks ) and access to ( e.g . safer storage ) firearms are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children , respectively , the researchers write.Of course , the weakening of firearm laws can have an impact as well . Following Missouri s decision to eliminate common-sense laws requiring people to have a permit to purchase a firearm , the state saw a homicide rate increase of 25 percent . No other changes in the law explain this increase . Stand Your Ground laws do nothing to reduce gun violence , but instead increase it ( especially among white men ) : Stand your ground laws were associated with a 6.8 % increase in homicide rates , mainly driven by increments ( 14.7 % ) in homicide rates among white males . While this can t be considered conclusive evidence that gun control helps limit fatalities , the study certainly provides enough evidence to give any Republican who can manage to operate a toaster without an adult supervising the operation pause to consider that maybe , just maybe , laws limiting firearms to people who aren t criminals , who aren t insane , and who aren t going to misuse them or act irresponsibly are in everyone s best interest even the most staunch Second Amendment supporter.Featured image via QuickMeme',\n",
       " 'Lou Dobbs rips on Speaker Paul Ryan because he s a do-nothing leader ! As Dobbs says , There s no mystery why Paul Ryan has a history of poor leadership Remember this ? Funding for Sanctuary Cities , benefits for illegal aliens , fully funded refugee programs , quadruples number of work visas for foreigners , release of criminal aliens , tax credits for illegal aliens , locking in huge spending increases , making America less safe and more Rep. Paul Ryan s first major legislative achievement is a total and complete sell-out of the American people masquerading as an appropriations bill.Too harsh , you say ? Let the programs , the spending , and the implications speak for themselves . ( 1 ) Ryan s Omnibus Fully Funds DACAThough much of the public attention has surrounded the President s 2014 executive amnesty , the President s 2012 amnesty quietly continues to churn out work permits and federal benefits for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens . Paul Ryan s bill funds entirely this 2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers or illegal immigrants who came to the country as minors.Specifically , Division F of Ryan s omnibus bill contains no language that would prohibit the use of funds to continue the President s unconstitutional program . Obama s executive action , known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , has granted around 700,000 illegal aliens with work permits , as well as the ability to receive tax credits and federal entitlement programs . A recent GAO report documented how this illegal amnesty program for alien youth is , in large part , responsible for the illegal alien minor surge on our southern border.In 2013 , Paul Ryan said that it is his job as a U.S. lawmaker to put himself in the shoes of the DREAMer who is waiting and work to find legislative solutions to his or her problems . ( 2 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Sanctuary CitiesFive months ago , 32-year-old Kate Steinle was bleeding to death in her father s arms . She was gunned down in broad daylight by a five-time deported criminal alien whose presence in the country was the direct result of San Francisco s refusal to comply with U.S. immigration law yet Paul Ryan s omnibus rewards these lawless Sanctuary Cities with federal grants . Division B Title II of Ryan s omnibus funds various grant programs for the Department of Justice ( pages 167 , 168 , and 169 ) and contains no language that would restrict the provision of such grants to sanctuary jurisdictions.In a Congressional hearing , Steinle s father demanded Congressional action and recalled his daughter s dying words : Help me , Dad . ( 3 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds All Refugee ProgramsDespite broad support amongst Republican lawmakers for a proposal introduced by Rep. Brian Babin ( R-TX ) to halt all refugee resettlement , Ryan s appropriations bill will fund President Obama s refugee resettlement operation and will allow for the admission of tens of thousands of refugees with access to federal benefits . Division H Title II of Ryan s bill contains appropriations of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and contains no language that would restrict the program . Nor are there any restrictions for the program in Division K of Ryan s bill , which provides funding for the Department of State , which oversees refugee admissions.Ryan is not one of the 84 cosponsors of Babin s bill to halt the refugee operation , and he recently told Sean Hannity that he does not support halting resettlement because , We re a compassionate country . The refugees laws are important laws . Similarly , this outcome represents a legislative win for Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) , who told Sean Hannity he d hate to use Congress s power of the purse to deny funding for Obama s resettlement operation . ( 4 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds All of the Mideast Immigration Programs That Have Been Exploited by Terrorists in Recent YearsAlthough multiple immigrant and visa programs in recent years have been exploited by terrorists ( such as the F-1 student visa , the K-1 fianc e visa , and our green card and refugee programs ) , Ryan s proposal does nothing to limit admissions from jihadist-prone regions . As Senators Shelby and Sessions of Alabama noted in a joint statement : The omnibus would put the U.S. on a path to approve admission for hundreds of thousands of migrants from a broad range of countries with jihadists movements over the next 12 months , on top of all the other autopilot annual immigration . ( 5 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Illegal Alien ResettlementOn page 917 of Ryan s omnibus a section titled Refugee and Entrant Assistance funds the President s resettlement of illegal immigrant border crossers . ( 6 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds the Release of Criminal AliensSenior legislative aides tell Breitbart News that Ryan s bill does not do anything to change the enforcement priorities that Jeh Johnson established a little over a year ago that would shield entire categories of criminal aliens from immigration law , nor does it include language recommended by Sessions and Shelby to deny the expenditure of funds to issue visas to countries that refuse to repatriate criminal aliens . ( 7 ) Ryan s Omnibus Quadruples H-2B Foreign Worker VisasDespite Ryan s pledge not to move an immigration compromise with President Obama , tucked 700 pages into Ryan s spending bill is language that would resuscitate and expand a controversial provision of the Schumer-Rubio Gang of Eight plan to increase the H-2B visa program.The provision would quadruple the number of H-2B visas for unskilled guest workers , for a total of more than 250,000 , writes immigration attorney Ian Smith . The Americans who fill these jobs are typically society s most vulnerable including single women , the disabled , the elderly , minorities , teenagers , students , and first-generation immigrants , Smith explains.A recent BuzzFeed expos revealed how this program allows businesses to discriminate against American workers and deliberately den [ y ] jobs to American workers so they can hire foreign workers on H-2 visas instead . As one GOP aide told Breitbart News , This provision is a knife in the heart of the working class , and African Americans . ( 8 ) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Tax Credits for Illegal AliensRyan s bill preserves the expansion of the President s expiring child tax credits without any accompanying language to prevent illegal aliens from receiving those tax credits . While Sen . Sessions attempted to include language in the bill that would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving tax credits , his recommendation was rejected . ( 9 ) Ryan s Omnibus Locks-In Huge Spending IncreasesThe bill funds the Obama-Boehner budget deal , which eliminated spending caps , and will increase both defense and non-defense spending next year by $ 25 billion more each . ( 10 ) Ryan s Omnibus Fails to Allocate Funds to Complete the 700-Mile Double-Layer Border Fence That Congress Promised the American PeopleNearly a decade ago with the passage of the 2006 Secure Fence Act , the American people were promised a 700-mile double-layer border fence . However , funding for the fence was later gutted and , as a result , its construction was never completed . Despite heightened media focus over the past six months about Americans desire for this barrier to illegal entry , Ryan s bill does not require that funds be allocated to finish the construction of the 700-mile double-layer fence.A vote could occur as early as Thursday after midnight , giving lawmakers and the public only one full business day to review the 2,242 page package . The Ryan-Pelosi package represents nothing short of a complete and total betrayal of the American people.Yet Ryan s omnibus serves a second and equally chilling purpose . By locking in the President s refugee , immigration , and spending priorities , Ryan s bill is designed to keep these fights out of Congress by getting them off the table for good . Delivering Obama these wins and pushing these issues beyond the purview of Congress will suppress public attention to the issues and , in so doing , will boost the candidacy of the Republican establishment s preferred presidential contenders , who favor President Obama s immigration agenda.What may prove most discouraging of all to Americans is that recent reports reveal that conservatives in the so-called House Freedom Caucus are praising Ryan even as he permanently locks in these irreversible and anti-American immigration policies . According to Politico , the House Freedom Caucus will give Ryan a pass even as he funds disastrous policies that prioritize the interests of foreign nationals and global corporatists above the needs of the American people whom lawmakers are supposed to represent .

       " 'PARIS - French police unearthed a second stash of explosive materials near Paris on Thursday after a similar find in a nearby suburb on Wednesday , a justice official said as three suspects were questioned by anti-terrorism investigators . Thursday s swoop was carried out at a garage rented by one of the three detained in the wake of Wednesday s raid on an apartment in Villejuif , on the southern edge of the French capital , the source said . Materials used to produce TATP , an explosive often used by suicide bombers , were found at the flat after a plumber phoned police to report suspect activity there , Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said . Two people in their 30s and 40s were arrested in the immediate wake of Wednesday s raid , said Collomb , who added that the suspects were being questioned on suspicion of terrorist activity despite talking of a bank heist . A third man was arrested overnight , a source said . Those under investigation spoke of wanting to blow up a bank with the TATP but they way we see it is they have links with terrorism , and this is the channel of investigation , Collomb told public radio station franceinfo . That line of inquiry was prompted by information found in telephone communications after the raid , he added . The minister spoke before developments later in the day in which police found explosive materials at a garage in Thiais , southeast of Paris . More than 230 people have been killed by Islamist-inspired attackers in the past three years in France , which along with the United States and other countries are bombing Islamic State bases in Iraq and Syria . TATP , an unstable explosive , has been used by militants in several attacks in western Europe in recent years , including Manchester in May , Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015 .',\n",

       " 'KIEV - Ukrainian supporters of former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili freed him from a police van on Tuesday after his detention on suspicion of assisting a criminal organisation led to clashes with police in Kiev . Once freed , Saakashvili raised a hand in a V-for-victory sign a handcuff still dangling from his wrist as he stood in a melee of supporters . He then led protesters towards parliament , where he called defiantly for President Petro Poroshenko to be removed from office . Prosecutors said they would make all efforts to regain custody of Saakashvili but the chaotic scenes of his detention and escape are likely to undermine the image of stability that Ukraine s leadership are keen to present to foreign backers . Ukrainian prosecutors suspect Saakashvili of receiving financing from a criminal group linked to former president Viktor Yanukovich which planned to overthrow the current government . He could face up to five years if found guilty . Saakashvili is also wanted in Georgia on criminal charges which he says were trumped up for political reasons . Masked officers had earlier dragged Saakashvili , 49 , from an apartment in the Ukrainian capital . But his supporters prevented the police van from moving off , hemming it in and eventually freeing him by breaking its windows and back door . Protesters also started assembling a barricade of tyres , wood and stones ripped up from the street in scenes reminiscent of Ukraine s 2013-14 pro-European Maidan uprising . Today you maybe saved me from death , therefore my life belongs to you , Saakashvili told a crowd at a makeshift camp outside parliament built by opposition supporters in September . The people of Ukraine must assemble and force the Ukrainian parliament to remove from power the criminal group led by the traitor to Ukraine , Poroshenko , he said . General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Saakashvili had a 24- hour deadline to present himself to the state security service , but subsequent comments by his press office suggested he could be detained earlier . All legal grounds for his detention have been established , spokesman Andriy Lysenko said . The detention was the latest twist in a prolonged feud between the Ukrainian authorities and Saakashvili , who was invited by Poroshenko to become a regional governor after the Maidan protests ousted a pro-Russian president in early 2014 . The two quickly fell out and Saakashvili turned on his one-time patron . It is unclear if Tuesday s events will lead to wider unrest , as Saakashvili enjoys limited support in Ukraine . Only 1.7 percent of voters would support his party , the Movement of New Forces , in elections , according to an October survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Centre think-tank . In a response to a request for comment on the case and on Saakashvili s comments on Poroshenko , the president s administration said law enforcement had found evidence to back up the claims against Saakashvili . These facts clearly demonstrate the true price of all the political and incriminating statements , which were recently made by Mikheil Saakashvili , it said in a statement . Georgian prosecutors said they had not been informed of Tuesday s developments by their Ukrainian counterparts . Saakashvili made a dramatic return to Ukraine in September , barging his way across the border from Poland despite having been stripped of Ukrainian citizenship and facing the threat of possible extradition to Georgia . He wants to unseat Poroshenko and replace him with a new , younger politician . His supporters have camped in tents outside parliament and launched sporadic protests since his return . We have been waiting for it ( the arrest ) for months , of course , and especially in the recent weeks , Saakashvili s wife Sandra Roelofs told Georgian TV Rustavi 2 . It s illegal and outrageous . Saakashvili received Ukrainian citizenship when he reinveted himself as a Ukrainian politician . He was made governor of the Odessa region in 2015 on the strength of the reforms he carried out in Georgia . But he fell out with Poroshenko , accusing him of corruption , while Poroshenko s office said Saakashvili was trying to deflect from his own shortcomings as an administrator . He was stripped of his citizenship by Poroshenko in July and is now stateless . Saakashvili s supporters see him as a fearless crusader against corruption but critics say there is little substance behind his blustery rhetoric . In his homeland , where he took power after a peaceful pro-Western uprising known as the Rose Revolution in 2003 , his time in office was tarnished by what critics said was his attempts to monopolise power and exert pressure on the judiciary . He was president at the time of a disastrous five-day war with Russia in 2008 , a conflict that his critics argued was the result of his own miscalculations .',\n",

       " 'President Obama made history yet again by making the rate for Americans without health insurance reach another historic low . However , you wouldn t know about it because virtually none of the mainstream media have talked about it on any level.Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index was updated on April 7th with new data for the first quarter of 2016 . The statistics have now been released , and it shows that the uninsured rate for American adults dropped to 11 percent , which is the lowest ever recorded in the poll s history.This unmitigated success has followed a trend since the third quarter of 2013 , which is the last one before the Affordable Care Act s mandate for health insurance took effect.The graph below shows the virtual bottoming out of the uninsured rate . Considering where we were as a nation only three years ago , coupled with the stubborn resistance of many in complying with the new requirements , the results are simply amazing.Not only are the results on the uninsured rate historic overall , but the largest benefits are among African-Americans , Hispanics , adults under 34 years of age , and adults making less than $ 36,000 per year . If Republicans really want to repeal every word of Obamacare as they promise to do , it would literally make their party go extinct . Young and minority voters will be lost to Republicans for a generation or more , and doom them extinction.The Republican plan during the 2016 election has been more of the same . Repeal , repeal , repeal with no plan to replace as usual . However , there has been a lot less talk of repeal as of late . Even Ted Cruz , who could have I will repeal every word of Obamacare chiseled on his tombstone , has been strangely silent on the issue .

       " 'After two very high profile mass shootings of police , which followed two very high profile shootings of black men by police , Lafayette , Louisiana Sheriff Louis Ackal is scared and despite being under federal indictment , he wants his guns back.Ackal is not a good guy , at least if you believe the indictments against him . He and his second in command , Lt. Col. Gerald Savoy , are accused of orchestrating the beatings of five pre-trial inmates in areas where video cameras couldn t catch them.Prosecutors allege Ackal directed deputies to assault the inmates three in connection with a lewd comment to a deputy , one for writing letters complaining about jail conditions and a fifth for no stated reason and was present in the chapel for at least one of the beatings.Source : The AdvocateEight inmates have died in the jail . One , the death of Victor White III is under federal investigation , and Reverend Victor White Sr. , the father of the victim , says all evidence points to the fact that his son was beaten to death . Ackal was asked to step down , and his response was it ll be a cold day in hell when I resign . Here s a video : Even beyond those accusations , Ackal is accused of antisemitic attacks against a federal prosecutor , calling him Jew bastard , and saying he s shoot the prosecutor between his Jewish eyes . According to a transcript of portions of the recording filed into the court record , Ackal made reference to this sorry son-of-a-bitch Jew bastard in Washington , saying he is going to send me to a federal pen . Ackal also talks about how prosecutors discussed a possible deal with the sheriff . You know about these people . You can give them to us , Ackal said , recalling what federal prosecutors told him . I said the only thing I m gon na give you f * * * * * g shoot you right between your g * * * * * * * d Jewish-eyes-look-like-opossum bastard . No one is denying he made the threat.Source : The AdvocateIn fact , his only defense was that his words were said in a fit of anger , as if no one has ever done anything violent in a fit of anger . Because of his fit of anger , and the alleged beatings of the inmates , Ackal s guns were taken away and now he says he s a sitting duck . In a court document filed this week , an attorney for the sheriff also claimed there was a threat made recently against a deputy . Though the threat against the deputy was not carried out , the atmosphere in this country , especially in south Louisiana , makes this a very realistic possibility , attorney John McLindon wrote . In view of what s happening across the country , I think it s wrong that I , as a police officer , am told that I can t carry a gun even though I ve not been convicted of anything , Ackal said Tuesday.It s absurd , but so very American , that this powder keg of a sheriff thinks he s entitled to his guns , despite what he s said and has allegedly done . It s doubtful that civilians , especially those of color , would ever get their guns back under similar circumstances , but this bigoted sheriff expects that his badge will give him special privileges , which is really a metaphor for our militarized police force.If Ackal is really in danger , which is possible given the accusations against him , a judge should put him in protective custody , either that , or give him back his guns and put the rest of the country in protective custody.Featured image via KLFY video screen capture .',\n",

President Donald Trump must decide on whether to send thousands of additional American troops overseas into the longest-running US combat theatre on the planet , Afghanistan.Back in March of 2016 , 21WIRE s Shawn Helton penned a insightful piece entitled , HAWKISH DOVE : The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House . In this article , Helton describes how then GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was putting forward a populist , alomist Paulist image among a bevy of warhawk and Neocon rivals.Back then , Helton described the media and political pressure placed on Trump : Recently , Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform . Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya , has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum . Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011 , is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down , the GOP frontrunner Trump , has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine and in true form to his business pedigree , stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict , rather than tow the party line . Onlookers wondered how this stance would play if Trump ever made into office . Back then it was immpossible to know , but now after 6 months in office , we have something to work with . We saw how fast Trump reacted to the alleged chemical weapons attack at Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib , Syria on April 4 , 2017 . His errant , knee-jerk cruise missile strike days later might go down in history as one of the biggest fumbles in US history ( if that s even possible to measure ) .Is Trump continuing down Obama s proven path of juggling multiple conflicts while engaging in illegal proxy wars ? Vanity Fair explains a possible fait accompli : On the campaign trail , Donald Trump pitched Americans on an immiscible foreign-policy agenda , combining elements of staunch isolationism and a rejection of Bush-era interventionism with promises to bomb the shit out of ISIS . But in his four months as president , Trump , characteristically , has done something of a 180-degree turn . He turned over much of his military policy and decision-making to the same embarrassing generals he previously claimed to know more than ; he authorized a missile strike and boots on the ground in Syria , a country he had repeatedly warned against getting involved with ; and he increased troop levels in Iraq , doubling down on a tactic he had called a horrible mistake . Now , the Trump administration is considering sending more troops into the war in Afghanistan , which he previously called a complete waste . On Tuesday , the president gave Defense Secretary James Mattis the authority to determine the number of troops in Afghanistan , The New York Times reports , a rejection of the management levels adopted by the Obama administration.Then there s the issue of rogue dinosaur John McCain , who refuses to retire and seems happy as ever to take down various and sundry nation-states , in order to quench his own desire for chaos and conflict : This dynamic has left some lawmakers frustrated . During a meeting last week in which Mattis conceded to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S. is not winning in Afghanistan right now , John McCain derided the delay of a broader strategy . We are now six months into this administration ; we still haven t got a strategy for Afghanistan , the Arizona senator said . It makes it hard for us to support you when we don t have a strategy . We know what the strategy was for the last eight years don t lose . That hasn t worked . Mattis responded , We are putting it together now , and there are actions being taken to make certain that we don t pay a price for the delay , he said . We recognize the need for urgency , and your criticism is fair , sir . It may be too early to tell , but getting the White House to decouple from Pentagon group-think may prove to be too hard a task for a President who is desperate for poll rating and a win , any win.Time will tell . * * * READ MORE SYRIA NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire SYRIA FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'BERLIN - Germany took a first decisive step on Wednesday toward forming a new government when its veteran finance minister , conservative Wolfgang Schaeuble , agreed to become president of the parliament , clearing the way for another party to take his job . Chancellor Angela Merkel will hope that Schaeuble , deeply respected in Germany for helping to steer the euro zone through its debt crisis , can stamp his authority on a fractious Bundestag lower house that will include two more parties after Sunday s federal election . Merkel must assemble Germany s first three-way coalition since the 1950s after her conservatives lost support and a far-right party , the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , entered parliament for the first time in half a century . In a sign of the challenges ahead , Andrea Nahles , the Social Democrats newly elected parliamentary leader , told reporters her party would hit conservatives squarely in the jaw after four years as junior partner in a Merkel-led grand coalition . Merkel s most realistic coalition option now is a deal with the pro-business Free Democrats ( FDP ) , returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus , and the Greens . But the parties disagree on issues such as energy , Europe and migration , complicating the path to a so-called Jamaica coalition - a reference to the parties colors : black , yellow and green , which are also those of the Jamaican flag . Schaeuble , 75 , who emerged as one of Europe s most influential politicians during the euro zone crisis , will bring unprecedented weight to the role of Bundestag president , normally a low-profile position . His willingness to quit as finance minister after eight years in the post makes it easier for the FDP to join a Merkel-led coalition . The FDP , who are as fiscally hawkish as Schaeuble , have said they want his old job . As an outstanding personality Wolfgang Schaeuble possesses a natural authority that is of particular importance in these times , said FDP leader Christian Lindner , himself seen as a likely successor at the finance ministry . Lindner s deputy , Wolfgang Kubicki , another possible candidate for the post , told the RND newspaper chain that Schaeuble s move showed Merkel s openness to a Jamaica coalition . He also underscored his party s call for a shift in fiscal policy . Schaeuble was criticized in southern Europe , especially Greece , for his insistence on tax hikes and spending cuts at a time of deep recession , but is popular at home for balancing the books and presiding over high growth and low unemployment . European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker , speaking in Munich , said he did not think Schaeuble s departure would soften the EU s approach to heavily indebted Greece . The austerity measures will be continued by those who carried them out together with Wolfgang Schaeuble , he said . The Free Democrats , with a voter support base among Germany s small and medium-sized businesses , are as committed to budgetary discipline as Schaeuble but less pro-European , meaning Wednesday s news drew a mixed reception from the euro zone . I don t think there will be radical changes in German economic policy if the FDP replaces him , said one official close to euro zone policy-making . The FDP are also hardliners on deficits . But another euro zone official said the euro zone was losing one of the most pro-European politicians I know and instead getting a party markedly cooler on political integration . Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told the Handelsblatt newspaper he would miss Schaeuble s steady hand . Wolfgang Schaeuble was a loyal discussion partner , serious , competent and also a good friend , he said . Merkel emerged from Sunday s election a weakened figure after her conservatives , still the largest bloc in the Bundestag , bled support to the AfD . But the exit of Schaeuble , the most powerful counterweight to the long-serving chancellor , could paradoxically strengthen her position . As Bundestag president , Schaeuble will not be involved in coalition negotiations , removing one strong-minded negotiator from the table and potentially giving Merkel a freer hand . Coalition negotiations will only begin in earnest after Oct. 15 , when the conservatives hope to wrest power from the Social Democrats in a state election in Lower Saxony . By law , the new parliament must convene for its first session 30 days after the election , so by Oct. 24 at the latest .',\n",
       " 'HARARE - A U.S. citizen was charged on Friday with attempting to overthrow the Zimbabwean government , which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail , after police earlier accused her of insulting 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe . Martha O Donovan , who works for Magamba TV , which describes itself as Zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire , was picked up in a dawn raid on her Harare home , her lawyer said . O Donovan , who denies both charges , was expected in court on Saturday , lawyer Obey Shava said . Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba could not be reached for comment on the new , much more serious , charge . O Donovan was first charged with insulting and undermining the president , according to a police charge sheet , which accused her of last month calling Mugabe a selfish and sick man on Twitter , the first such arrest since the creation of a Ministry of Cyber Security last month . That charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail , her lawyer said . Shava said police then accused O Donovan of setting up Magamba , being behind a shadowy Twitter character called @ matigary and setting up another Twitter account @ OpenParlyZw for the sole purpose of overthrowing the government through unconstitutional means . The government has been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his # ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration , the biggest anti-government protest in a decade . A national election is due in 2018 . The police search warrant showed that central to its investigation was a post on O Donovan s Twitter feed referring to a Goblin whose wife and step-sons had imported a Rolls-Royce , an apparent reference to Mugabe , though he was not named . In a statement to police seen by Reuters , O Donovan said : I deny the allegations being leveled against me as baseless and malicious . That is all I wish to say . The U.S. embassy in Harare confirmed an American citizen had been arrested and said it was monitoring the situation closely . Shava said his client had refused to sign a new document known as a warned and cautioned statement with the fresh charge . The document sets out the government s case and signing it signals a suspect understands the charge . She had signed the statement on the lesser charge . Police seized her computers , cellphones and other electronic devices in the raid on her home .',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS - European Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that it was up to Britain to determine if there was to be a good deal or no deal in Brexit talks . We have managed to build and maintain unity among the 27 , but ahead of us is still the toughest stress test . If we fail it , the negotiations will end in our defeat . We must keep our unity regardless of the direction of the talks . The EU will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided , Tusk , who chairs summits of EU leaders , told the European Parliament . It is in fact up to London how this will end , with a good deal , no deal or no Brexit but in each of these scenarios we will protect our common interests only by being together , he said .',\n",
       " 'This sounds exactly like what a dictator would do to humiliate his opponents.Because according to former Apprentice star and director of Trump s pathetic African-American Outreach effort Omarosa Manigault , Trump has plans for dealing with those who have criticized or opposed him should he become president.In a promo for PBS upcoming Frontline documentary that examines the lives of the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton , Manigault makes an appearance to sing the praises of her boss and to fire a warning shot towards his detractors . Donald Trump is running for president because he believes that he can help turn the nation around , Manigault said . More importantly , every critic , every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump . Here s the video via YouTube.This is just another sign that Donald Trump intends to rule like a dictator rather than a leader who gets his power by virtue of the people . America is NOT a monarchy . People do not bow down to the president . But that is apparently what Trump has in mind for anyone who has ever criticized him , insulted him , crossed him , or stood in his way.And that makes his close ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin all the more alarming , which is why legendary ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov has warned that Trump is acting an awful lot like a Soviet dictator . And he would know since he defected from the Soviet Union 42 years ago precisely because of the kinds of policies Trump is advocating for now such as oppression of people based on race and religion , building walls , and being a psychopath in general.Trump has even called for gun nuts to assassinate Hillary Clinton and has encouraged his supporters to chant in favor of locking her in prison . Assassination and imprisonment are exactly what dictators do to their political opponents.This is why Americans must exercise their right to vote this November because if Trump comes to power that right may not exist much longer.Featured image via screen capture',\n",

       " \"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has been recently designated by the Donald Trump for President campaign as their go-to opener for his campaign rallies . He did so in jaw-dropping fashion on Monday as the Trump campaign launched another event with a bizarre statement.Hyping up Trump , Giuliani made the insane statement that before the presidency of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State , the United States didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S. Video of Rudy saying we did n't `` have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S. '' before Obama : pic.twitter.com/3tC1InfZj0 andrew kaczynski ( @ BuzzFeedAndrew ) August 15 , 2016Of course , the reality is that the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States was perpetrated by radical Islamic terrorists under the banner of al Qaeda on September 11 , 2001.The attacks killed thousands of people in New York City , Washington D.C. , and Pennsylvania.The statement is even more jaw-dropping because few major politicians are as identified with 9/11 as Giuliani , who served as mayor of New York City on the day of the attack and famously walked with firefighters and police through the rubble after the attacks.He even based much of his failed 2004 presidential run on his actions on that day.The president at the time was of course President George W. Bush , the Republican . By contrast , Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. marines on May 2 , 2011 in a raid on his compound in Afghanistan that was ordered by President Barack Obama.The conservative movement has for years tried to argue that they are stronger against terrorism than Democrats , and as an outgrowth they have worked to down play Democratic successes in that fight . There has been an intense crackdown on terrorists during Obama s seven years as President , including rolling up on the al Qaeda network , ISIS , and other groups.Giuliani s statement is a blatant lie , but it has strong support with hardcore conservatives.Featured image via Twitter\",\n",
       " 'Donald Trump s inauguration was one of the most disappointing in American history , but he keeps desperately trying to sell it as one of the best.Actual attendance at Trump s inauguration didn t even get close to a million people as aerial photos show that much of the National Mall was empty by the time Trump delivered his divisive and negative inaugural address.Neilson television ratings for Trump s inauguration were not much better as 31 million tuned in to watch a national tragedy unfold before their eyes.But Trump is bragging about this number on Twitter and comparing it to President Obama s second inauguration ratings as if he thinks he deserves some sort of prize for cherry-picking an inauguration that got lower ratings.Wow , television ratings just out : 31 million people watched the Inauguration , 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago ! Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 22 , 2017The problem is that Trump deliberately chose to compare his inauguration to President Obama s second inauguration because his numbers were far lower than Obama s first inauguration .
